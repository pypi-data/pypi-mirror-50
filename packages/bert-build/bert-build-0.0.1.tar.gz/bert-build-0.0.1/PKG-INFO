Description: 
        bert
        ====
        
        Bert builds things in a similar manner to the `docker build` command, but with
        the intended output being things other than just docker images.
        
        Known Limitations
        ------------------
        
        * Bert does not clean up very well after itself.
        * Types of tasks is currently somewhat limited (and does not have feature
          parity with `docker build`).
        * The docker commit process while creating an image can timeout, but resuming
          the run after the commit actually commits will work.
        * Bert doesn't integrate very well into CI servers yet.
        * Needs tests and examples.
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        From checkout, use pip: `pip install --user .`
        
        Bert may appear on pypi in the future.
        
        Usage
