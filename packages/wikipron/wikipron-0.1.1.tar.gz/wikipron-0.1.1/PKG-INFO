        WikiPron is a command line toolkit for scraping grapheme-to-phoneme (G2P) data
        from Wiktionary.
        
        ## Installation
        
        WikiPron requires Python 3.6+. It is available through pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install wikipron
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        After installation, the terminal command `wikipron` will be available.
        As a basic example, the following command scrapes G2P data for French
        (with the ISO language code `fr`):
        
        ```bash
        wikipron fr
        ```
        
        By default, the results appear on the terminal,
        where each line has the orthography of a word, followed by a tab and then
        the word's pronunciation in IPA.
        
        For example commands using advanced options,
        the [`languages/wikipron/scrape`](languages/wikipron/scrape) script shows
        how a multilingual G2P dataset can be created.
        
        For a full list of command-line options, please run `wikipron -h`.
        
        The underlying module can also be used from Python.
        A standard workflow looks like:
        
        ```python
        import wikipron
        
        config = wikipron.Config(key="fr")  # French, with default options.
        for word, pron in wikipron.scrape(config):
            ...
        ```
