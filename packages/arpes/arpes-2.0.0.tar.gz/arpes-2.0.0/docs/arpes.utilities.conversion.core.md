# arpes.utilities.conversion.core module

Helper functions for coordinate transformations. All the functions here
assume standard polar angles, for better or worse, so you might need to
massage your inputs slightly in order to get them into an appropriate
form.

Functions here must accept constants or numpy arrays as valid inputs, so
all standard math functions have been replaced by their equivalents out
of numpy. Array broadcasting should handle any issues or weirdnesses
that would encourage the use of direct iteration, but in case you need
to write a conversion directly, be aware that any functions here must
work on arrays as well for consistency with client code.

Through the code that follows, there are some conventions on the names
of angles to make the code easier to follow:

Standard vertically oriented cryostats:

‘polar’ is the name of the angle that describes rotation around hat{z}
‘beta’ is the name of the angle that describes rotation around hat{x}
‘sample\_phi’ is the name of the angle that describes rotation around
the sample normal ‘phi’ is the name of the angle that describes the
angle along the analyzer entrance slit

Additionally, everywhere, ‘eV’ denotes binding energies. Other energy
units should be labelled as:

Kinetic energy -\> ‘kinetic\_energy’ Binding energy -\>
‘binding\_energy’ Photon energy -\> ‘hv’

Other angles: Sample elevation/tilt/beta angle -\> ‘polar’ Analyzer
polar angle -\> ‘phi’

> “Forward” or “backward” converts the data to momentum space.

> 
> “Forward” By converting the coordinates, rather than by interpolating
> the data. As a result, the data will be totally unchanged by the
> conversion (if we do not apply a Jacobian correction), but the
> coordinates will no longer have equal spacing.
> 
> This is only really useful for zero and one dimensional data because
> for two dimensional data, the coordinates must become two dimensional
> in order to fully specify every data point (this is true in
> generality, in 3D the coordinates must become 3D as well).
> 
> The only exception to this is if the extra axes do not need to be
> k-space converted. As is the case where one of the dimensions is
> *cycle* or *delay*, for instance.

> Points can either by specified by coordinates, or by reference to
> symmetry points, should they exist in the source array. These symmetry
> points are translated to regular coordinates immediately, but are
> provided as a convenience. If not all points specify the same set of
> coordinates, an attempt will be made to unify the coordinates. As an
> example, if the specified path is (kx=0, ky=0, T=20) -\> (kx=1, ky=1),
> the path will be made between (kx=0, ky=0, T=20) -\> (kx=1, ky=1,
> T=20). On the other hand, the path (kx=0, ky=0, T=20) -\> (kx=1, ky=1,
> T=40) -\> (kx=0, ky=1) will result in an error because there is no way
> to break the ambiguity on the temperature for the last coordinate.

> A reasonable value will be chosen for the resolution, near the maximum

> This function transparently handles the entire path. An alternate

> If the sentinel value ‘G’ for the Gamma point is included in the
> interpolation points, the coordinate axis of the interpolated
> coordinate will be shifted so that its value at the Gamma point is 0.
