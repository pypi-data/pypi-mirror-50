        This repository contains image classes to perform transformations on images with landmarks (similar to [menpo](https://github.com/menpo/menpo) but with much less dependencies). It also provides some basic Datasets for [delira](https://github.com/justusschock/delira)
        
        ## Installation
        This package can be installed via `pip install shapedata`
        
        ## Basic Usage
        To load a single image with landmarks you can simply do
        
        ```python
        import shapedata
        img = shapedata.SingleShapeSingleImage2D.from_files("./example_files/lenna.png")
        ```
        
        and to view this image do
        ```python
        from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
        img.view(view_landmarks=True)
        plt.show()
        ```
        
        To augment the image you can use `img.transform()` to transform the image with the origin as transformation base or `img.transform_about_centre()` to use the images's center as transformation base.
        Transformations as `img.translate()`, `img.rotate()`, `img.rescale()` or `img.resize()` are also implemented and will fall back on `img.transform()` or `img.transform_about_centre()`
        
        To access the image itself you can do `img.img` and accessing the landmarks works with `img.lmk` for instances of `SingleShapeSingleImage`
        For further usage have a look at the datasets and docstrings.
