Description: # A small module for getting diagonals in a 2D Array
        
        ```python
        import diagonal
        arr = [] #your array
        ```
        
        ### Definition
        
        #### get(arr, start = "0", direction = "up", type="all")
        
        **start** (single character)
        
        0 - start from the first row
        
        m - start from m'th row
        
        **direction** (string)
        
        up - uses upward direction for traversal
        
        down - downward direction for traversal
        
        **type **(string)
        
        all - default value which indicates that all diagonals are considered
        
        main - gives the main diagonal of square matrix
        
        anti - gives anti diagonal of square matrix
        
        zigzag - gives zigzag traversal of the matrix
        
        
        
        ---
        
        
        
        ### Usages
        
        1. Square matrix
        
           * Main diagonal  `diagonal.get(arr, type = "main")`
        
           * Anti diagonal `diagonal.get(arr, type = "anti")`
        
           * Also zigzags upwards and downwards
        
             ` diagonal.get(arr, type = "zigzag" ,direction ="up")`
        
        2. Other matrices
        
           All traversals except main and anti diagonals
        
           Ex: `diagonal.get(arr, start = "0", direction = "up")` gives all diagonals starting from the first elements traversed in upward direction.
        
        ### Return values
        
        * Any errors return a string
        
        * Main and Anti diagonal traversals returns a list
        
        * ZigZag traversals return a list
        
        * Others return a list of list having individual diagonals
