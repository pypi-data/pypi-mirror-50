Keanu
=====

Keanu is a general purpose probabilistic programming library developed by Improbable's research team.
It enables you to build Bayesian networks through which you can make
probabilistic predictions about large, complex and multifaceted problems.

This is an early stage, pre-alpha version of Keanu. We have an ambitious team
attempting to build an even more ambitious product with the help of the open source community.
