DESCRIPTION
-----------

``abimap`` is a tool to generate and update linker scripts which add version
information to symbols exported by a shared library.

It is intended to be integrated as part of the build process to check for
changes in the set of exported symbols and update the symbol version linker
script accordingly.

The complete documentation can be found at https://abimap.readthedocs.io
