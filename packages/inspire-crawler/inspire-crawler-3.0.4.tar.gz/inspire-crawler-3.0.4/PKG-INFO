        Crawler integration with INSPIRE-HEP using scrapy project `HEPCrawl`_.
        
        This module allows scheduling of crawler jobs to a `Scrapyd`_ instance serving
        a `Scrapy`_ project. E.g. in this case the default scrapy project is `HEPCrawl`_.
        
        It integrates directly with `invenio-workflows`_ module to create workflows for every
        record harvested by the crawler.
        
        This module is meant to use only with `INSPIRE-HEP`_ overlay. **Use at own risk.**
