.. important:: There are 2 files in each subfolder of `this repo's examples directory <https://github.com/2bndy5/CircuitPython_nRF24L01/tree/master/examples>`_. Only the file used for the raspberry pi is displayed here. Each subfolder represents a different test scenario. Both files (pi_test.py & m4_test.py) are identical with the exception of one line: The pin assignment to the ``ce`` variable. If you've connected the nRF24L01's CE or CSN pins to different pins (compared to what we specified in the examples), then you need change that pin assignment accordingly before running these examples/tests.

Simple test
