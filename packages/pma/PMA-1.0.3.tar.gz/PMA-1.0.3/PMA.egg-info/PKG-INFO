Description: # PiXL Maths App Farm
        
        This project requires at least Python 3.6 (can probably use lower versions but not tested).
        The tool is designed to work with [PiXL's Maths App](https://mathsapp.pixl.org.uk/PMA2.html).
        It was created by reverse engineering the flash file and took a huge amount of time so any
        support is appreciated.
        
        ## Setup
        1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
        2. Run `pip install -U pma` in your terminal/command prompt. This is the same command to update
        
        There are also [docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/orangutan/pma).
        
        ## CLI Usage
        * `pma farm --help`
        * `python -m pma farm --help`
        * `python -m pma farm --goal 100 SCHOOL_ID USERNAME PASSWORD`
        * `python -m pma farm --yes SCHOOL_ID USERNAME PASSWORD`
        * `python -m pma farm --goal 100 --yes SCHOOL_ID USERNAME PASSWORD`
