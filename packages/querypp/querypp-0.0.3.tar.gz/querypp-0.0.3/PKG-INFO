        querypp preprocesses SQL queries[1] in order to allow conditional inclusion at runtime.
        It also includes a loader which loads many queries from a file, delimited by `-- :name query_name` lines.
        
        [1] Although it is trivially adapted to other languages with line comments,
            as the only SQL-specific assumption is the comment syntax.
        
        Take an example:
        
        ```
        SELECT *
        FROM users
        -- :block profiles
        LEFT JOIN profiles USING (user_id)
        -- :block login_history
        LEFT JOIN login_history USING (profile_id)
        -- :endblock
        -- :endblock
        -- :block user_id WHERE user_id = $1
        ```
        
        A Query object can be called:
          - with no block names to return the entire query
          - with one or more block names to return the query with only those block names.
        
        In this case, `q('profiles', 'user_id')` would return the query with the `login_history` JOIN removed.
        
        ## Motivation
        
        After moving all my SQL queries to separate files (using the `load_sql` function),
        I noticed that I was duplicating some of them except for one extra clause.
        I created this to allow me to deduplicate such queries.
