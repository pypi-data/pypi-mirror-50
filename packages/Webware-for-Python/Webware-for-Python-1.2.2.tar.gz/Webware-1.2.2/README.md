# Webware for Python

Webware for Python is a suite of Python packages and tools for developing object-oriented, web-based applications. The suite uses well known design patterns and includes a fast Application Server, Servlets, Python Server Pages (PSP), Object-Relational Mapping, Task Scheduling, Session Management, and many other features. Webware is very modular and easily extended.

Webware for Python is well proven and platform-independent. It is compatible with multiple web servers, database servers and operating systems.

This repository contains the current development aimed at modernizing Webware while still maintaining much of the old spirit and trying to stay compatible where possible.
