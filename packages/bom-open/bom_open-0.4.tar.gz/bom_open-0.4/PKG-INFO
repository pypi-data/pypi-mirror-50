        Python 3 context manager to open a file or stdio. When reading in text mode, encoding can be detected with chardet. When reading Unicode, always chooses an encoding which removes Byte Order Mark (utf-8-sig, utf-16 or utf-32).
        
        Additional arguments are passed to `open()`.
        
        Python writes a Byte Order Mark for utf-8-sig, utf-16, or utf-32.  Python does not write BOM when endianness is specified.
        
        Differences from `open()`
        -------------------------
        If `file=None` or `'-'`, open stdin (when reading) or stdout (when writing).
        
        If `encoding=None` and `mode` is readable and text mode ('r' or 'w+'),
        file encoding will be detected using chardet.
