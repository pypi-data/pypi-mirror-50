Description: 
        AIMBAT is an open-source software package for efficiently measuring teleseismic
        body wave arrival times for large seismic arrays (Lou et al., 2013). It is
        based on a widely used method called MCCC (multi-channel cross-correlation)
        developed by VanDecar and Crosson (1990). The package is automated in the
        sense of initially aligning seismograms for MCCC which is achieved by an
        ICCS (iterative cross-correlation and stack) algorithm. Meanwhile, a
        graphical user interface is built to perform seismogram quality control
        interactively. Therefore, user processing time is reduced while valuable
        input from a user's expertise is retained. As a byproduct, SAC (Goldstein
        et al., 2003) plotting and phase picking functionalities are replicated
        and enhanced.
