        A python package to evaluate source separation results using the [MUSDB18](https://sigsep.github.io/musdb) dataset. This package is part of the [MUS task](https://sisec.inria.fr/home/2018-professionally-produced-music-recordings/) of the [Signal Separation Evaluation Campaign (SISEC)](https://sisec.inria.fr/). Using this package is mandatory for submitting results to SiSEC as it includes the reference implementation of the new BSSEval version 4.
        
        ### BSSEval v4
        
        The BSSEval metrics, as implemented in the [MATLAB toolboxes](http://bass-db.gforge.inria.fr/bss_eval/) and their re-implementation in [mir_eval](http://craffel.github.io/mir_eval/#module-mir_eval.separation) are widely used in the audio separation literature. One particularity of BSSEval is to compute the metrics after optimally matching the estimates to the true sources through linear distortion filters. This allows the criteria to be robust to some linear mismatches. Apart from the optional evaluation for all possible permutations of the sources, this matching is the reason for most of the computation cost of BSSEval, especially considering it is done for each evaluation window when the metrics are computed on a framewise basis.
        
        For this package, we enabled the option of having _time invariant_ distortion filters, instead of necessarily taking them as varying over time as done in the previous versions of BSS eval. First, enabling this option _significantly reduces_ the computational cost for evaluation because matching needs to be done only once for the whole signal. Second, it introduces much more dynamics in the evaluation, because time-varying matching filters turn out to over-estimate performance. Third, this makes matching more robust, because true sources are not silent throughout the whole recording, while they often were for short windows.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Package installation
        
        You can install the `museval` parsing package using pip:
        
        ```bash
        pip install museval
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        The purpose of this package is to evaluate source separation results and write out standardized `json` files that can easily be parsed by the SiSEC submission system. Furthermore we want to encourage users to use this evaluation output format as the standardized way to share source separation results for processed tracks. We provide two different ways to use `museval` in conjunction with your source separation results.
        
        ### Run and Evaluate
        
        - If you want to perform evaluation while processing your source separation results, you can hook `museval` into your `musdb` user_function:
        
        Here is an example for such a function separating the mixture into a __vocals__ and __accompaniment__ track:
        
        ```python
        import musdb
        import museval
        
        output_dir = ...
        estimates_dir = ...
        
        def estimate_and_evaluate(track):
            # generate your estimates
            estimates = {
                'vocals': track.audio,
                'accompaniment': track.audio
            }
        
            # Evaluate using museval
            scores = museval.eval_mus_track(
                track, estimates, output_dir=output_dir
            )
        
            # print nicely formatted mean scores
            print(scores)
        
            # return estimates as usual
            return estimates
        
        # your usual way to run musdb
        mus = musdb.DB()
        [estimate_and_evaluate(track) for track in mus]
        
        ```
        
        - Make sure `output_dir` is set. `museval` will recreate the `musdb` file structure in that folder and write the evaluation results to this folder. __This whole folder should be submitted for your SiSEC contribution__.
        
        ### Evaluate later
        
        If you have already computed your estimates, we provide you with an easy-to-use function to process evaluation results afterwards.
        
        Simply use the `museval.eval_mus_dir` to evaluate your `estimates_dir` and write the results into the `output_dir`. For convenience, the `eval_mus_dir` function accepts all parameters of the `musdb.run()`. That way e.g. multiprocessing can easily be enabled by setting `parallel=True`:
        
        ```python
        import musdb
        import museval
        
        # initiate musdb
        mus = musdb.DB()
        
        # evaluate an existing estimate folder with wav files
        museval.eval_mus_dir(
            dataset=mus,  # instance of musdb
            estimates_dir=...,  # path to estimate folder
            output_dir=...,  # set a folder to write eval json files
            subsets="Test",
            is_wav=False
        )
        ```
        
        :bulb: When evaluating later, please make sure you use the same environment used for separation or use the [decoded wav dataset](https://github.com/sigsep/sigsep-mus-io). This is important since the reference sources are loaded from the stems on the fly and certain FFMPEG version produce different zero-padding. We tested several different machines and ffmpeg version and did not run into any problems, but we cannot guarantee that the decoded outputs of two different ffmpeg versions are identical and would not affect the bsseval scores. E.g. when silence > 512 samples would be added in the beginning of a target source.
        
        ### Aggregate and Analyze Scores
        
        Scores for each track can also be aggregated in a pandas DataFrame for easier analysis or the creation of boxplots.
        To aggregate multiple tracks in a DataFrame, create `museval.EvalStore()` object and add the track scores successively.
        
        ```python
        results = museval.EvalStore(frames_agg='median', tracks_agg='median')
        for track in tracks:
            # ...
            results.add_track(museval.eval_mus_track(track, estimates))
        ```
        
        When all tracks have been added, the aggregated scores can be shown using `print(results)` and results may be saved as a pandas DataFrame `results.save('my_method.pandas')`.
        
        To compare multiple methods, create a `museval.MethodStore()` object add the results
        
        ```python
        methods = museval.MethodStore()
        methods.add_evalstore(results, name="XZY")
        ```
        
        To compare against participants from [SiSEC MUS 2018](https://github.com/sigsep/sigsep-mus-2018), we provide a convenient method to load the existing scores on demand using `methods.add_sisec18()`. For the creation of plots and statistical significance tests we refer to our [list of examples](/examples).
        
        #### Commandline tool
        
        We provide a command line wrapper of `eval_mus_dir` by calling the `museval` command line tool. The following example is equivalent to the code example above:
        
        ```
        museval -p --musdb path/to/musdb -o path/to/output_dir path/to/estimate_dir
        ```
        
        :bulb: you use the `--iswav` flag to use the decoded wav _musdb_ dataset.
        
        ### Using Docker for Evaluation
        
        If you don't want to set up a Python environment to run the evaluation, we would recommend to use [Docker](http://docker.com). Assuming you have already computed your estimates and installed docker in your machine, you just need to run the following two lines in your terminal:
        
        #### 1. Pull Docker Container
        
        Pull our precompiled `sigsep-mus-eval` image from [dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/r/faroit/sigsep-mus-eval/):
        
        ```
        docker pull faroit/sigsep-mus-eval
        ```
        
        #### 2. Run evaluation
        
        To run the evaluation inside of the docker, three absolute paths are required:
        
        * `estimatesdir` will stand here for the absolute path to the estimates directory. (For instance `/home/faroit/dev/mymethod/musdboutput`)
        * `musdbdir` will stand here for the absolute path to the root folder of musdb. (For instance `/home/faroit/dev/data/musdb18`)
        * `outputdir` will stand here for the absolute path to the output directory. (For instance `/home/faroit/dev/mymethod/scores`)
        
        We just mount these directories into the docker container using the `-v` flags and start the docker instance:
        
        ```
        docker run --rm -v estimatesdir:/est -v musdbdir:/mus -v outputdir:/out faroit/sigsep-mus-eval --musdb /mus -o /out /est
        ```
        
        In the line above, replace `estimatesdir`, `musdbdir` and `outputdir` by the absolute paths for your setting.  Please note that docker requires absolute paths so you have to rely on your command line environment to convert relative paths to absolute paths (e.g. by using `$HOME/` on Unix).
        
        :warning: `museval` requires a significant amount of memory for the evaluation. Evaluating all five targets for _MUSDB18_ may require more than 4GB of RAM. If you use multiprocessing by using the `-p` switch in `museval`, this results in 16GB of RAM. It is recommended to adjust your Docker preferences, because the docker container might just quit if its out of memory.
