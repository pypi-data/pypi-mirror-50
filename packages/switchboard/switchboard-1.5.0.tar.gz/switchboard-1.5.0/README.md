Switchboard
===========

Switchboard is a Python WSGI app that makes it easy to [toggle
features](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feature_toggle) in
a variety of Python web frameworks. Created to enable
[A/B](https://www.optimizely.com/optimization-glossary/ab-testing/) and [user
testing](https://www.experienceux.co.uk/faqs/what-is-usability-testing/)
at [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/), it features an easy-to-use admin
dashboard with powerful conditions for activating a particular feature.

What follows is an abbreviated version of [Switchboard's full
documentation](http://switchboard.readthedocs.io/).

## Getting Started

Want to use Switchboard in your application? Keep reading. Interested in
developing on Switchboard or running a small example locally? Take a
look at the [Development](#development) section.

### Installing

Install Switchboard and its dependencies using pip:

```
pip install switchboard
```

### Setup

Next, embed Switchboard and its admin UI within the application.
Framework-specific details can be found in [Switchboard's
documentation](http://switchboard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-documentation.html#installation).

### Using Switches

Switchboard's basic unit is a switch. Every switch has a unique key
associated with it and is either active (on) or inactive (off), so using
it in code is simple:

```
>>> from switchboard import operator
>>> operator.is_active('foo')
False
```

In this case we checked to see if the "foo" switch was active. By
default, Switchboard will auto-create any switches that don't already
exist, such as "foo". Auto-created switches default to an inactive
state. This just scratches the surface; [there's so much more that a switch can
do](http://switchboard.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user-documentation.html#using-switches).

## Development

These instructions cover setting Switchboard up locally for development and
testing purposes. See [Getting Started](#getting-started) for notes on how to
use Switchboard within a web application.

### Prerequisites

* Virtualenv: `$ sudo easy_install virtualenv`

### Bootstrapping

1. Make a virtualenv workspace: `$ virtualenv --no-site-packages .venv`
1. Activate the virtualenv:     `$ source .venv/bin/activate`
1. Install all dependencies:    `$ make install`

### Running the Example App

Switchboard includes an
[example](https://github.com/switchboardpy/switchboard/blob/master/example/server.py)
application, which is handy both for doing development and for taking it for a
test drive in a very simple environment. It also provides an example of
setting Switchboard up to run within a
[Bottle](https://www.fullstackpython.com/bottle.html)-based application.

To run:

```
$ make example
```

At this point a very simple application is now running at
`http://localhost:8080` and the admin UI is accessible at
`http://localhost:8080/_switchboard/`. The application has one switch
(`example`) and outputs text that tells you whether the switch is active.

### Running Tests

Switchboard includes both unit tests and functional tests of the admin
dashboard, using the example application.

To run the unit tests:

```
$ make test
```

The functional test requires both an updated
[Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/) and
[geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver):

```
$ npm install -g geckodriver
```

To run the functional tests:

```
$ make functional-test
```

### Releasing

To distribute a new release of Switchboard:

1. Update the version in `setup.py`, following [Semantic
   Versioning](http://semver.org).
1. Cut the release:
```
$ make release
```

### Versioning

We use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) for versioning. For the
versions available, see the [tags on this
repository](https://github.com/switchboardpy/switchboard/tags).
