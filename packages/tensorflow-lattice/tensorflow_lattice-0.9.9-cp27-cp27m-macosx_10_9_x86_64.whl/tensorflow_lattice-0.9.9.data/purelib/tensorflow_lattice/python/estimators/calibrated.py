  """Creates a calibration layer for the input using hyper-parameters.

  Similar to `input_calibration_layer` but reads its parameters from a
  `CalibratedHParams` object.

  Args:
    columns_to_tensors: A mapping from feature name to tensors.
    hparams: Hyper-parameters, need to inherit from `CalibratedHParams`. See
      `CalibratedHParams` and `input_calibration_layer` for descriptions of how
      these hyper-parameters work.
    quantiles_dir: location where quantiles for the data was saved. Typically
      the same directory as the training data. These quantiles can be generated
      with `pwl_calibration_layers.calculate_quantiles_for_keypoints`, maybe in
      a separate invocation of your program. Different models that share the
      same quantiles information -- so this needs to be generated only once when
      hyper-parameter tuning. If you don't want to use quantiles, you can set
      `keypoints_initializers` instead.
    keypoints_initializers: if you know the distribution of your input features
      you can provide that directly instead of `quantiles_dir`. See
      `pwl_calibrators_layers.uniform_keypoints_for_signal`. It must be a pair
      of tensors with keypoints inputs and outputs to use for initialization
      (must match `num_keypoints` configured in `hparams`). Alternatively can be
      given as a dict mapping feature name to pairs, for initialization per
      feature. If `quantiles_dir` and `keypoints_initializer` are set, the
      latter takes precendence, and the features for which
      `keypoints_initializers` are not defined fallback to using the quantiles
      found in `quantiles_dir`.
    name: Name scope for layer.
    dtype: If any of the scalars are not given as tensors, they are converted to
      tensors with this dtype.

  Returns:
    A tuple of:
    * calibrated tensor of shape [batch_size, sum(features dimensions)].
    * list of the feature names in the order they appear in the calibrated
      tensor. A name may appear more than once if the feature is
      multi-dimension (for instance a multi-dimension embedding)
    * list of projection ops, that must be applied at each step (or every so
      many steps) to project the model to a feasible space: used for bounding
      the outputs or for imposing monotonicity. Empty if none are requested.
    * tensor with regularization loss, or None for no regularization.

  Raises:
    ValueError: if dtypes are incompatible.
