"""
Foreword: THIS IS NOT THE TELNET PROTOCOL!
Telnet clients nowadays just use a half-assed ASCII based tcp socket,
but telnet is much much more than that!!!!

That being sad, if someone want's to do actual telnet implementation 
I'm willing to buy him a beer or two, if it can do pretty terminals.

Now enjoy this half-assed protocol impelemtation from yours truly!
