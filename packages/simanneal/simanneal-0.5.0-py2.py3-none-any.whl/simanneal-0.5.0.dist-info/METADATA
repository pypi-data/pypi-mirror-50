`simanneal` is a python implementation of the
[simulated annealing optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulated_annealing) technique.

Simulated annealing is used to find a close-to-optimal solution among an
extremely large (but finite) set of potential solutions. It is particularly
useful for [combinatorial optimization](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization)
problems defined by complex objective functions that rely on external data.
