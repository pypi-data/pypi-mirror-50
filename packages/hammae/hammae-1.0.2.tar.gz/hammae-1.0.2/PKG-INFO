        This package provides a Python 3 ported version of Python 2.7's ``hammae``
        module. It has also been back-ported to work in Python 2.6.
        
        In Python 3, the implementation of ``randrange()`` was changed, so that even
        with the same seed you get different sequences in Python 2 and 3. Note that
        several high-level functions such as ``randint()`` and ``choice()`` use
        ``randrange()``.
        
        In my testing code I heavily rely on stable hammae generator results and it
        makes porting code to Python 3 a lot harder, if all those tests have to be
        adjusted. This package fixes that.
