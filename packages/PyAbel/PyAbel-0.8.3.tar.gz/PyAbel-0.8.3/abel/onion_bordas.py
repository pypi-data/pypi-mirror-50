    http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/rsi/85/11/10.1063/1.4899267

    The algorithm actually originates from this 1996 RSI paper by Bordas et al:

    http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/rsi/67/6/10.1063/1.1147044

    This function operates on the "right side" of an image. i.e. it works on 
    just half of a cylindrically symmetric image.  Unlike the other transforms,
    the left edge should be the image center, not mid-first pixel. This 
    corresponds to an even-width full image. 
                           
    However, shift_grid=True (default) provides the typical behavior,
    where the first pixel corresponds to the center pixel of the image.

    To perform a onion-peeling transorm on a whole image, use ::
    
        abel.Transform(image, method='onion_bordas').transform

    Parameters
    ----------
    IM : 1D or 2D numpy array
        right-side half-image (or quadrant)

    dr : float
        sampling size (=1 for pixel images), used for Jacobian scaling.
        The resulting inverse transform is simply scaled by 1/dr.

    direction: str
        only the `direction="inverse"` transform is currently implemented
   
    shift_grid: boolean
        place width-center on grid (bottom left pixel) by shifting image 
        center (0, -1/2) pixel 

    Returns
    -------
    AIM: 1D or 2D numpy array
        the inverse Abel transformed half-image
