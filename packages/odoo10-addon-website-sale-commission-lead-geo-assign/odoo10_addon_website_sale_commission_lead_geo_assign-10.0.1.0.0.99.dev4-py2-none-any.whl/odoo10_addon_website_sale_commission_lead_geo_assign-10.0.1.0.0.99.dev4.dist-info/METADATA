This module allows to assign agents to field *Assigned Partner* of leads, according to their location:

* The agent's location is specified in the tab *Agent information*;
* The lead's location is computed by its address.

Agents are assigned to leads right after lead creation.

This module comes with a CRON (to be activated) that assigns agents to all the leads.

**Table of contents**

.. contents::

Usage
=====

Select *Geo assign agents* from the lead's context menu.

The CRON can get two parameters:

* leads: a recordset of leads to assign (all leads if nothing is specified)
