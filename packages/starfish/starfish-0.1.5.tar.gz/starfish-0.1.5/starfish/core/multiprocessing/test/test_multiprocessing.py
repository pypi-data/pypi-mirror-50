    This method leverages multiprocessing.Pool to test process initializers and shared memory array
    decoders.

    Starts a process Pool and passes :py:method:`SharedMemory.initializer` as its initializer, which
    will store `array_holder` as a global variable inside the initialized process.

    Creates `bound_func`, which will be executed by the subprocesses of Pool.  `bound_func` is a
    partial function constructed from :py:method:`_write_to_shared_memory_array` that exposes
    `decoder`, a method that gets a numpy array out of array_holder and then writes a value to it
    (inside the spawned process).

    This enables writing of tests that check whether the written values are available in the parent
    processes, which depends on `SharedMemory.initializer`, `array_holder`, and `decoder`.

    All the subprocesses must complete before this method returns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    array_holder : Any
        An object that when passed to the callable specified in `decoder`.  This is the object that
        is passed in :py:class:`multiprocessing.Pool`'s initargs.
    decoder : Callable[[Any], np.ndarray]
        A callable that takes the object in `array_holder` and returns a np.ndarray.
    nitems : int
        Number of jobs to spawn.  Each job will write a single element of the array.
