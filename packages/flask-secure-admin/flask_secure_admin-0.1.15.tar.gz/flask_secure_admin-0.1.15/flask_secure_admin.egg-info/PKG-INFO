        # flask_secure_admin
        
        My little bundling of flask-admin and flask-security. Drawn heavily from the flask-admin example repo, also integrating sqlsoup because when I made it I didn't want to declare any models. Could be adapted to work with flask-sqlalchemy, surely.
        
        ## Development
        
        ### Uploading the package
        
        ```sh
        # Update setup.py version number
        python setup.py sdist
        twine upload dist/flask_secure_admin-x.x.x.tar.gz # use the last version created
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Run the following from a virtual environment:
        
            pip install flask-secure-admin  # Or use pipenv
        
        Add the following python to your project:
        
        ```python
        from flask_secure_admin import SecureAdminBlueprint
        app.db = SQLSoup(os.environ['DATABASE_URI'])
        app.register_blueprint(SecureAdminBlueprint(name='Your Project Name'))
        ```
        
        Last, Run this to create necessary database tables in your database (PostgreSQL):
        
            // Turns into, for example: psql yourdatabase < /Users/you/.local/share/virtualenvs/env-aP3G_9r-/lib/python3.7/site-packages/flask_secure_admin/create.sql
            psql yourdatabase < $(dirname $(which pip))/../lib/$(python --version | sed 's/..$//' | sed 's/ //' | awk '{print tolower($0)}')/site-packages/flask_secure_admin/create.sql;    
        
        This will create the tables: users, roles, & users_roles, so if you have any of those, this won't work.
        In that case, you're probably best off making sure you have each of the fields required on users and roles.
        See the create.sql file for reference.
        
        At this point, you're set! Run your app, there should now be a protected '/admin' route.
