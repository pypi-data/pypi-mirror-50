For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.14/v3/search/#text-match-metadata).\n\nSee \"[Searching topics](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-topics/)\" for a detailed list of qualifiers.\n\nSuppose you want to search for topics related to Ruby that are featured on [https://github.com/topics](https://github.com/topics). Your query might look like this:\n\nIn this request, we're searching for topics with the keyword `ruby`, and we're limiting the results to find only topics that are featured. The topics that are the best match for the query appear first in the search results.\n\n**Note:** A search for featured Ruby topics only has 6 total results, so a [Link header](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.14/v3/#link-header) indicating pagination is not included in the response.",
