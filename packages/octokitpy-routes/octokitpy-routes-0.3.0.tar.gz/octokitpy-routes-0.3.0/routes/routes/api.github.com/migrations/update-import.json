In those cases the import progress will have the status `detection_found_multiple` and the Import Progress response will include a `project_choices` array. You can select the project to import by providing one of the objects in the `project_choices` array in the update request.\n\nThe following example demonstrates the workflow for updating an import with \"project1\" as the project choice. Given a `project_choices` array like such:\n\nTo restart an import, no parameters are provided in the update request.",
