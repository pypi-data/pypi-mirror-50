    "description": "**Note:** Accessing this endpoint does not count against your REST API rate limit.\n\n**Understanding your rate limit status**\n\nThe Search API has a [custom rate limit](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.15/v3/search/#rate-limit), separate from the rate limit governing the rest of the REST API. The GraphQL API also has a [custom rate limit](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.15/v4/guides/resource-limitations/#rate-limit) that is separate from and calculated differently than rate limits in the REST API.\n\nFor these reasons, the Rate Limit API response categorizes your rate limit. Under `resources`, you'll see three objects:\n\n*   The `core` object provides your rate limit status for all non-search-related resources in the REST API.\n*   The `search` object provides your rate limit status for the [Search API](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.15/v3/search/).\n*   The `graphql` object provides your rate limit status for the [GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.15/v4/).\n\nFor more information on the headers and values in the rate limit response, see \"[Rate limiting](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.15/v3/#rate-limiting).\"\n\nThe `rate` object (shown at the bottom of the response above) is deprecated.\n\nIf you're writing new API client code or updating existing code, you should use the `core` object instead of the `rate` object. The `core` object contains the same information that is present in the `rate` object.",
