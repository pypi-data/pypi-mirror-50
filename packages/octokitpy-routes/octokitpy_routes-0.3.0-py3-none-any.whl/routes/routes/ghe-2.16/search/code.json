For more details about how to receive highlighted search results, see [Text match metadata](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.16/v3/search/#text-match-metadata).\n\n**Note:** You must [authenticate](https://developer.github.com/enterprise/2.16/v3/#authentication) to search for code across all public repositories.\n\n**Considerations for code search**\n\nDue to the complexity of searching code, there are a few restrictions on how searches are performed:\n\n*   Only the _default branch_ is considered. In most cases, this will be the `master` branch.\n*   Only files smaller than 10 MB are searchable.\n\nSuppose you want to find the definition of the `addClass` function inside [jQuery](https://github.com/jquery/jquery). Your query would look something like this:\n\nHere, we're searching for the keyword `addClass` within a file's contents. We're making sure that we're only looking in files where the language is JavaScript. And we're scoping the search to the `repo:jquery/jquery` repository.",
