Mesh
====

The mesh is implemented as a half-edge datastructure.
It is meant for the representation of polygonal *"surface"* meshes. A mesh can be
connected or disconnected. A mesh can be closed or open. A mesh can be comprised
of only vertices.

Network
=======

The network is a connectivity graph.
It is meant for the representation of networks of vertices connected by edges.
The edges are directed. A network does not have faces. A network can be connected
or disconnected. A network with vertices only is also a valid network.

VolMesh
=======

The volmesh is a cellular mesh. It is implemented as
a half-plane, the three-dimensional equivalent of a half-edge. It can, for example,
be used for the representation of subdivided/partitioned polyhedra.
