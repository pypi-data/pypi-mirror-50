        """ Abstract base class representing a mapper, which maps unmasked pixels on a masked 2D array (in the form of \
        a grid, see the *hyper.array.grid_stack* module) to discretized pixels in a pixelization.

        1D arrays are used to represent these mappings, for example between the different grid_stack in a grid-stack \
        (e.g. the regular / sub grid_stack). This follows the syntax grid_to_grid, whereby the index of a value on one grid \
        equals that of another grid, for example:

        - image_to_pix[2] = 1  tells us that the 3rd pixel on a regular grid maps to the 2nd pixel of a pixelization.
        - sub_to_pix4] = 2  tells us that the 5th sub-pixel of a sub-grid maps to the 3rd pixel of a pixelization.
        - pix_to_image[2] = 5 tells us that the 3rd pixel of a pixelization maps to the 6th (unmasked) pixel of a \
                            regular grid.

        Parameters
        ----------
        pixels : int
            The number of pixels in the mapper's pixelization.
        grid_stack: grid_stack.GridStack
            A stack of grid's which are mapped to the pixelization (includes an regular and sub grid).
        border : grid_stack.RegularGridBorder
            The border of the grid-stack's regular-grid.
        hyper_image : ndarray
            A pre-computed hyper-image of the image the mapper is expected to reconstruct, used for adaptive analysis.

    def mapping_matrix(self):
        """The mapping matrix is a matrix representing the mapping between every unmasked pixel of a grid and \
        the pixels of a pixelization. Non-zero entries signify a mapping, whereas zeros signify no mapping.

        For example, if the regular grid has 5 pixels and the pixelization 3 pixels, with the following mappings:

        regular pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 0
        regular pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 0
        regular pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 4 -> pixelization pixel 2

        The mapping matrix (which is of dimensions regular_pixels x pixelization_pixels) would appear as follows:

        [1, 0, 0] [0->0]
        [1, 0, 0] [1->0]
        [0, 1, 0] [2->1]
        [0, 1, 0] [3->1]
        [0, 0, 1] [4->2]

        The mapping matrix is in fact built using the sub-grid of the grid-stack, whereby each regular-pixel is \
        divided into a regular grid of sub-pixels which are all paired to pixels in the pixelization. The entires \
        in the mapping matrix now become fractional values dependent on the sub-grid size. For example, for a 2x2 \
        sub-grid in each pixel (which means the fraction value is 1.0/(2.0^2) = 0.25, if we have the following mappings:

        regular pixel 0 -> sub pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 0
        regular pixel 0 -> sub pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 0 -> sub pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 0 -> sub pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 1 -> sub pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 1 -> sub pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 1 -> sub pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 1 -> sub pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 1
        regular pixel 2 -> sub pixel 0 -> pixelization pixel 2
        regular pixel 2 -> sub pixel 1 -> pixelization pixel 2
        regular pixel 2 -> sub pixel 2 -> pixelization pixel 3
        regular pixel 2 -> sub pixel 3 -> pixelization pixel 3

        The mapping matrix (which is still of dimensions regular_pixels x source_pixels) would appear as follows:
