# Welcome to the PyAutoLens test suite data maker. Here, we'll make the suite of data that we use to test and profile
# PyAutoLens. This consists of the following sets of images:

# A lens only image, where the lens is an elliptical Dev Vaucouleurs profile.
# A lens only image, where the lens is a bulge (Dev Vaucouleurs) + Envelope (Exponential) profile.
# A lens only image, where there are two lens galaxies both composed of Sersic bules.
# A source-only image, where the lens mass is an SIE and the source light is a smooth Exponential.
# A source-only image, where the lens mass is an SIE and source light a cuspy Sersic (sersic_index=3).
# The same smooth source image above, but with an offset lens / source centre such that the lens / source galaxy images
# are not as the centre of the image.
# A lens + source image, where the lens light is a Dev Vaucouleurs, mass is an SIE and the source light is a smooth
# Exponential.
# A lens + source image, where the lens light is a Dev Vaucouleurs, mass is an SIE and source light a cuspy Sersic
# (sersic_index=3).

# Each image is generated at 5 resolutions, 0.2" (LSST), 0.1" (Euclid), 0.05" (HST), 0.03" (HST), 0.01" (Keck AO).

# To simulate each lens, we pass it a name and call its maker. In the makers.py file, you'll see the
