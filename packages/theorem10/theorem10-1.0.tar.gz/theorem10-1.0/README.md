# Theorem10 [A theorem in Mathematics]
This repository includes a computer program for a mathematical theorem paper titled "A theorem on numbers of the form 10^x"

Author: [Ravin Kumar](https://mr-ravin.github.io)

### Demonstration

```python
import theorem10
x=4 # we took x=4 as an example, for number of form 10^x 
num_bits=theorem10.get_bits(x)  # here, we pass x to get_bits function, and it returns number of bits 
                                # that will always represent total numbers greater than 10^x
```

### PyPi package installation

```
pip3 install theorem10
```
