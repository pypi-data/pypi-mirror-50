GENERAL INFORMATION
Due to an infrastructure grant from the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) the contents of BRENDA can now be made available for free
download. The information is in form of a text file the structure
of which is similar but not identical to the Swissprot/Trembl/Uniprot text file format so that parsers written
for that file could be easily modified. Information on the
structure of the file is given at the end of this README.

INFORMATION ON CONTENTS
The file is organised in an EC-number specific format. The
information on each EC-number is given in a very short and compact
way in a part of the file. The contents of each line are described
by a two/three letter acronym at the beginning of the line and
start after a TAB. Empty spaces at the beginning of a line
indicate a continuation line.

The contents are organised in 40 information fields as given
below. Protein information is included in '#'...#', literature
citations are in '<...>', commentaries in '(...)' and field-
special information in '{...}'.

Protein information is given as the combination organism/Uniprot
accession number where available. When this information is not
given in the original paper only the organism is given.
