# astro_metadata_translator

Observation metadata handling infrastructure

This package can be used to translate headers from astronomical
instrumentation into a standard form.  This allows the details
of particular headers to be hidden from the user of the data
files.

This package was developed by the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
Data Management team.

It does not depend on any LSST software.
