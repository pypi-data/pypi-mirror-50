Description: # kerneloose
        
        Python implementation of the kernel method for out-of-sample extension (OOSE) of dimensionality reduction techniques.
        
        Based on ["Parametric nonlinear dimensionality reduction using kernel t-SNE" by Gisbrecht, Schulz, and Hammer](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231214007036).
        
        The kernel method is particularly useful for projection techniques that are computationally expensive and/or have non-convex objective functions, such as [t-SNE](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html).
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install kerneloose
        ```
        
        ## Usage example
        
        The syntax follows scikit learn conventions.
        Assume `hd_data` is a numpy array containing high-dimensional data, and an array `ld_data` of equal length but lower dimension was obtained by some projection technique.
        An OOSE of that projection can be obtained by:
        
        ```python
        from kerneloose import KernelMap
        
        kernel_oose = KernelMap()
        kernel_oose.fit(hd_data, ld_data)
        ```
        
        The mapping can be applied to `new_data` (with same dimensionality as `ld_data`) simply by:
        
        ```python
        kernel_oose.transform(new_data)
        ```
        
        Parameters of the calculated OOSE mapping can be saved and loaded for later use:
        
        ```python
        kernel_oose.save('some/file/name')
        
        resume_later = KernelMap()
        resume_later.load('some/file/name')
        ```
