Description: # OSM Export Tool
        
        > This project is under development. For the previous version of the Export Tool, see [hotosm/osm-export-tool](https://github.com/hotosm/osm-export-tool/tree/master/ops).
        
        ## Example usage
        
        ```
        osm-export-tool jakarta.osm.pbf jakarta -f gpkg,shp
        ```
        
        Input formats:
        * OSM PBF
        * OSM XML
        
        Output formats:
        * OSM PBF
        * OSM XML
        * GeoPackage
        * Shapefile
        * KML
        * OsmAnd
        * Maps.ME
        * Garmin
        
        1. OGC GeoPackage (.gpkg)
        * This is the default export format, and the most flexible for modern GIS applications. 
        
        2. Shapefile (.shp)
        * Each layer and geometry type is a separate .SHP file. This is because each .SHP file only supports a single geometry type and column schema. 
        
        3. KML (.kml)
        * Each layer and geometry type is a separate .KML file. This is because the GDAL/OGR KML driver does not support interleaved writing of features with different geometry types. 
        
        4. Maps.ME
        
        5. OsmAnd
        
        6. Garmin
