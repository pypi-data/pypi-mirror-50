"""
Inject events from outside the scope of the NG submission system.

A core concept of the :mod:`arxiv.submission.domain.event` model is that
the state of a submission can be obtained by playing forward all of the
commands/events applied to it. That works when all agents that operate
on submission state are generating commands. The problem that we face in
the short term is that some operations will be performed by legacy components
that don't generate command/event data.

The objective of the :class:`ClassicEventInterpolator` is to reconcile
NG events/commands with aspects of the classic database that are outside its
current purview. The logic in this module will need to change as the scope
of the NG submission data architecture expands.
