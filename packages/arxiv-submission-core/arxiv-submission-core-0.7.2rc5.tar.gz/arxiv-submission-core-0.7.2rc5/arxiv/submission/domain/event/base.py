    Base class for submission-related events/commands.

    An event represents a change to a :class:`.domain.submission.Submission`.
    Rather than changing submissions directly, an application should create
    (and store) events. Each event class must inherit from this base class,
    extend it with whatever data is needed for the event, and define methods
    for validation and projection (changing a submission):

    - ``validate(self, submission: Submission) -> None`` should raise
      :class:`.InvalidEvent` if the event instance has invalid data.
    - ``project(self, submission: Submission) -> Submission`` should perform
      changes to the :class:`.domain.submission.Submission` and return it.

    An event class also provides a hook for doing things automatically when the
    submission changes. To register a function that gets called when an event
    is committed, use the :func:`bind` method.

        """
        Generate a decorator to bind a callback to an event type.

        To register a function that will be called whenever an event is
        committed, decorate it like so:

        .. code-block:: python

           @MyEvent.bind()
           def say_hello(event: MyEvent, before: Submission,
                         after: Submission, creator: Agent) -> Iterable[Event]:
               yield SomeOtherEvent(...)

        The callback function will be passed the event that triggered it, the
        state of the submission before and after the triggering event was
        applied, and a :class:`.System` agent that can be used as the creator
        of subsequent events. It should return an iterable of other
        :class:`.Event` instances, either by yielding them, or by
        returning an iterable object of some kind.

        By default, callbacks will only be called if the creator of the
        trigger event is not a :class:`.System` instance. This makes it less
        easy to define infinite chains of callbacks. You can pass a custom
        condition to the decorator, for example:

        .. code-block:: python

           def jill_created_an_event(event: MyEvent, before: Submission,
                                     after: Submission) -> bool:

        condition : Callable

            the callback will be triggered when the event to which it is bound
            is saved. The default condition is that the event was not created
            by :class:`System`
