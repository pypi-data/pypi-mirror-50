Description: # diffenv
        Compare development environments
        
        ## Install
        
        To install normally:
        
        ```bash
        pip3 install diffenv
        # call command with
        diffenv
        ```
        
        
        ## Development
        
        If you are developing locally, do _not_ install as above, and instead run the following in the repo root directory:
        
        ```bash
        # depending on your setup you may have to prefix sudo to this command
        pip install --editable .
        ```
        
        The above should keep updating with local changes to your repository.
        
        If you ran the above command with `sudo`, you may have to do the following:
        
        ```bash
        sudo chown -R youruser:youruser diffenv.egg-info dist
        ```
        
        Now you can run
        ```bash
        diffenv
        ```
