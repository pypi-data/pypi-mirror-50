Ground Obs Monthly Mean MF and SV field for Olivier 23.06.2017
C. Finlay
------------
- Based on BGS checked OBS Hourly Mean datafiles 1997 to April 2017 taken from  ftp://ftp.nerc-murchison.ac.uk/geomag/Swarm/AUX_OBS/hour/
- Revised monthly means computed as described in Olsen et al. (2014), taking robust mean of months of HMV (all local times), after subtracting CM4 SQ preds and CHAOS-6-x2 magnetospheric model predictions

- Formatted in similar syle to VO data files

Diagonal covariance matrix for ground obs MF, covariances computed from residuals to CHAOS-6-x3 after removal of bias.

GR_OBS_RMM_SV.40
Monthly SV values, locations and times, observatories listed sequentially in order of co-latitude.
