# pypi-sphinx-quickstart

## Overview

This repo is a template to use for starting a new Python package
which is hosted on PyPi and uses Sphinx for documentation
hosted on Github pages.

## Getting Started

Click the "Use this template" button at the top of the repo page, then 
fill out the name and description your new repo. Once you have the repo,
make the following edits.

### Github Pages Setup

Go to repo settings, Github Pages section. For the Source dropdown, 
select "master branch /docs folder". The settings page should reload,
and in the Github Pages section it should show the URL of your 
documentation. You should be able to see the documentation at the URL
after a few seconds, but it will still be the example documentation.

### `conf.py`

Edit `conf.py` in the main repo directory. This contains the main 
settings for the PyPi package.
