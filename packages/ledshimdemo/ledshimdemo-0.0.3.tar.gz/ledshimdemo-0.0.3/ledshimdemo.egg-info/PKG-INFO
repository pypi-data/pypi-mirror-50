        Display a variety of effects on the Raspberry Pi [led-shim](https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/led-shim) from Pimoroni.
        
        The effects are based on the examples given in the base [library](https://github.com/pimoroni/led-shim) plus some 
        additions from my [fork](https://github.com/RatJuggler/led-shim/tree/more-examples).
        
        - Binary Clock - Shows hours, minutes and seconds.
        - Candle - A flickering candle.
        - CheerLights - Synchronize with the [CheerLights](https://cheerlights.com) "Internet of Things" project.
        - Coloured Lights - Simple coloured lights like Xmas lights.
        - Gradient Graph - A moving colour gradient determined by the height of a sine wave.
        - Rainbow - A slowly moving rainbow effect.
        - Random Blink - Some random blinking.
        - Solid Colours - A basic effect which just shows a sequence of solid colours.
        
        **Note**, this project is somewhat over-engineered for what it actually does because it's being used as a learning exercise.
