Description: Tools for Value-Driven Design
        =============================
        
        Tools intended to help with modelling decisions in a value centric
        design process. The intent is to keep this as generic as possible, as
        some of this decision modelling is suited to generic decision-making,
        non-design activities with a little massaging.
        
        Features
        --------
        
        -  Concept Design Analysis (CODA) method implementation
        -  Requirements weighting with a Binary Weighting Matrix
        -  Programmatic or Excel-based models.
        
        Roadmap
        -------
        
        -  Model sets for comparative work (rather than a single set of
           characteristic parameter values).
        -  Improved visualisation.
        -  Export CODA models to Excel template.
        -  House of Quality style requirement/characteristic weighting.
