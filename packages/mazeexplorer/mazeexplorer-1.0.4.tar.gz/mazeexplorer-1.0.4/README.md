# MazeExplorer

MazeExplorer is a customisable 3D benchmark for assessing generalisation in Reinforcement Learning.

Simply put, MazeExplorer makes it easy to create separate training and test environments for your agents.

It is based on the 3D first-person game [Doom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_(1993_video_game)) and the open-source
environment [VizDoom](https://github.com/mwydmuch/ViZDoom).

This repository contains the code for the MazeExplorer Gym Environment along with the scripts to generate baseline results.

# The Mission

The goal is to navigate a procedurally generated maze and collect a set number of keys.

The environment is highly customisable, allowing you to create different training and test environments.

The following features of the environment can be configured:
- Unique or repeated maps
- Number of maps
- Map Size (X, Y)
- Maze complexity
- Maze density
- Random/Fixed keys
- Random/Fixed textures
- Random/Fixed spawn
- Number of keys
- Environment Seed
- Episode timeout
- Reward clipping
- Frame stack
- Resolution
- Action frame repeat
- Actions space
- Specific textures (Wall,
ceiling, floor)
- Data Augmentation

# Example Usage

```python
from mazeexplorer import MazeExplorer

train_env = MazeExplorer(number_maps=1,
              size=(15, 15),
              random_spawn=True,
              random_textures=False,
              keys=6)
              
test_env = MazeExplorer(number_maps=1,
              size=(15, 15),
              random_spawn=True,
              random_textures=False,
              keys=6)

# training
for _ in range(1000):
    obs, rewards, dones, info = train_env.step(train_env.action_space.sample())
    
    
# testing
for _ in range(1000):
    obs, rewards, dones, info = test_env.step(test_env.action_space.sample())
```
