            notate a note but not actually play it. For instance, i.e. when there is some sort of playback alteration
            like staccato, a "silent" note with the original properties that does none of the alterations gets notated,

        :param max_volume: This is a bit of a pain, but since midi playback requires us to set the velocity at the
            beginning of the note, and thereafter vary volume using expression, and since expression can only make the
            note quieter, we need to start the note with velocity equal to the max desired volume (using expression to
            adjust it down to the actual start volume). The default will be 1, meaning as loud as possible, since unless
            we know in advance what the note is going to do, we need to be prepared to go up to full volume. Using
            play_note, we do actually know in advance how loud the note is going to get, so we can set max volume to the
            peak of the Envelope. Honestly, I wish I could separate this implementation detail from the ScampInstrument
