********
Overview
********

**ReynirCorrect** is a Python 3.x package for
**checking and correcting spelling and grammar** in Icelandic text.

ReynirCorrect uses the `Reynir <https://pypi.org/project/reynir/>`_ package,
by the same authors, to tokenize and parse text.

Token-level correction
----------------------

ReynirCorrect can tokenize text and return a corrected token list.
This catches token-level errors, such as spelling errors and erroneous
phrases, but not grammatical errors.

Full grammar analysis
---------------------

ReynirCorrect can also analyze text grammatically by attempting to parse
it, after token-level correction. The parsing is done according to Reynir's
context-free grammar for Icelandic, augmented with additional production rules for common
grammatical errors. The analysis returns a set of annotations (errors and suggestions)
that apply to spans (consecutive tokens) within sentences in the resulting
token list.

******
Status
******

This code is under development and has early Beta status. It will eventually
become the foundation of a spelling and grammar checker that will be open
to the public on the `Greynir.is <https://greynir.is>`_ website.
Of course it will also be available as an open-source Python package
that can be installed using ``pip``.

*******
Example
*******

To tokenize text with token-level correction (the text is not parsed in this case,
so no grammar checking is done):

>>> from reynir_correct import tokenize
>>> g = tokenize("Af gefnu tilefni fékk fékk daninn vilja sýnum "
>>>     "framgengt við hana í auknu mæli.")
>>> for tok in g:
>>>     print("{0:10} {1}".format(tok.txt or "", tok.error_description))

Output::

   Að         Orðasambandið 'Af gefnu tilefni' var leiðrétt í 'að gefnu tilefni'
   gefnu
   tilefni
   fékk       Endurtekið orð ('fékk') var fellt burt
   Daninn     Orð á að byrja á hástaf: 'daninn'
   vilja      Orðasambandið 'vilja sýnum framgengt' var leiðrétt í 'vilja sínum framgengt'
   sínum
   framgengt
   við
   hana
   í          Orðasambandið 'í auknu mæli' var leiðrétt í 'í auknum mæli'
   auknum
   mæli
   .

To get a list of spelling and grammar annotations for a sentence:

>>> from reynir_correct import check_single
>>> sent = check_single("Páli, vini mínum, langaði að horfa á sjónvarpið.")
>>> for annotation in sent.annotations:
>>>     print("{0}".format(annotation))

Output::

   000-004: E003  Frumlag sagnarinnar 'að langa' á að vera í þolfalli en ekki í þágufalli

                  [ The subject of the verb 'að langa/to want' should be in the
                     accusative case, not the dative case ]

Note that the ``annotation.start`` and ``annotation.end`` properties
(here ``start`` is 0 and ``end`` is 4) contain the indices of the first and last
tokens to which the annotation applies. ``E003`` is an error code.
