Description: Bulker
        ======
        
        Bulker is a command-line manager of containerized executables. It
        produces drop-in replacements to command line tools so that they can be
        run in a container without any additional user effort. It also will
        manage collections of tools that can be activated or deactivated.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        1 Install bulker
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        ::
        
           pip install --user bulker
        
        2 Load a crate
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        A bulker crate is a collection of executables that run inside
        containers. To load a bulker crate, you need a manifest, which lists the
        commands and images included in this crate. Use ``demo_manifest.txt``
        for example:
        
        ::
        
           bulker load -m https://raw.githubusercontent.com/databio/bulker/master/demo/demo_manifest.yaml
        
        Loading this crate will give you drop-in replacement command-line
        executables for any commands in the manifest.
        
        3 Activate your new crate:
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Activate a crate with ``bulker activate``:
        
        ::
        
           bulker activate demo
        
        Now run any executables in the crate as if they were installed natively:
        
        ::
        
           cowsay Hello World!
            ______________ 
           < Hello world! >

                         ## ## ##       ==            
                      ## ## ## ##      ===            
                  /""""""""""""""""___/ ===        
             ~~~ {~~ ~~~~ ~~~ ~~~~ ~~ ~ /  ===- ~~~
