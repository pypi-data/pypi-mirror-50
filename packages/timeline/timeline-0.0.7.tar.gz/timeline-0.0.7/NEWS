Changes and improvements to timeline, grouped by release.

0.0.7
-----

* Include LICENSE, NEWS, and timeline/tests/ in the sdist. (Colin Watson)

0.0.6
-----

* Use floor division so that intervals are always represented as integer
  numbers of milliseconds, preserving output compatibility between Python 2
  and 3. (Colin Watson)

0.0.5
-----

* Add Python 3 support. (Colin Watson)

0.0.4
-----

* The default stack formatter now no longer includes itself in the formatted
  stack. (Robert Collins, #891989)

0.0.3
-----

* Added a .testr.conf to support easy testing. (Robert Collins)

* Relicensed under LGPL 3. (Robert Collins)

* TimedAction.logTuple() now returns 5-tuples with the last element the
  backtrace for the action, or None if none was set. (Robert Collins)

* Timeline now gathers backtraces by default. This can be disabled by
  passing format_stack=None, or customised by passing a replacement
  callable. (Robert Collins)

0.0.2
-----

* Added a WSGI integration module - very simple, just injects a Timeline into
  environ as 'timeline.timeline'.
