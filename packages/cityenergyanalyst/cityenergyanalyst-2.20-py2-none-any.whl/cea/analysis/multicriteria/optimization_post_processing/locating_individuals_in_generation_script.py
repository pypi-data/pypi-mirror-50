"""
Locating individuals in generation script

In optimization, the best individuals stored might be from different generations. The corresponding files of these
best individuals are not reproduced but referenced based on their generation and the individual number.

This function takes in all the individuals from a generation and links the address of the individual.
For example, from checkpoint of generation 25, the individual 1 is referenced to generation 10 and individual 5
(of that generation)

It creates a csv file, which can be used to do further analysis
