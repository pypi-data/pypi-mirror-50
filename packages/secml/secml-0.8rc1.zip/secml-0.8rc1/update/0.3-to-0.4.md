## From 0.3.*-dev to 0.4-dev

Make sure you view this update guide from the tag (version) of SecML you would like to install. 
In most cases this should be the highest numbered production tag (without rc in it).

To update the current `v0.3.*-dev` version to `v0.4-dev`, run the following steps:

### 1. Move `SECML_HOME_DIR`

The default folder where `SecML` data is stored has changed. It is now set as:
 * Unix -> `$HOME/secml-data`
 * Windows -> `($HOME, $USERPROFILE, $HOMEPATH, $HOMEDRIVE)/secml-data`
    
To keep existing data make sure to move the existing folder into the new location.

For Unix platform this can be done by running:
```bash
mv ~/secml-lib-data ~/secml-data
```


### 2. Update configuration file

1. The default name of the configuration file has changed to `secml.conf`.

   This file should be already inside `SECML_HOME_DIR` as `secml-lib.conf`.
   If exists, please now rename the file to `secml.conf`.

   For Unix platform this can be done by running:
   ```bash
   mv ~/secml-data/secml-lib.conf ~/secml-data/secml.conf
   ```

2. Inside the configuration file, please replace the section `[secml-lib]` with `[secml]`.
