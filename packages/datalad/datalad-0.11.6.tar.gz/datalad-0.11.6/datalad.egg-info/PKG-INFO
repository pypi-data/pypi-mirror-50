        10000ft overview
        ================
        
        DataLad makes data management and data distribution more accessible. To
        do that, it stands on the shoulders of `Git <https://git-scm.com>`__ and
        `Git-annex <http://git-annex.branchable.com>`__ to deliver a
        decentralized system for data exchange. This includes automated
        ingestion of data from online portals and exposing it in readily usable
        form as Git(-annex) repositories, so-called datasets. The actual data
        storage and permission management, however, remains with the original
        data providers.
        
        The full documentation is available at: http://docs.datalad.org
        
        Extensions
        ==========
        
        A number of extensions are available that provide additional
        functionality for DataLad. Extensions are separate packages that are to
        be installed in addition to DataLad. In order to install DataLad
        customized for a particular domain, one can simply install an extension
        directly, and DataLad itself will be automatically installed with it.
        Here is a list of known extensions:
        
        -  `tracking web resources and automated data
           distributions <https://github.com/datalad/datalad-crawler>`__
           `crawler
           release <https://GitHub.com/datalad/datalad-crawler/releases/>`__
        -  `neuroimaging research data and
           workflows <https://github.com/datalad/datalad-neuroimaging>`__
           `neuroimaging
           release <https://GitHub.com/datalad/datalad-neuroimaging/releases/>`__
        -  `support for containerized computational
           environments <https://github.com/datalad/datalad-container>`__
           `container
           release <https://GitHub.com/datalad/datalad-container/releases/>`__
        -  `alternative set of basic commands with improved cross-platform
           support <https://github.com/datalad/datalad-revolution>`__
           `revolution

        with a ``datalad`` tag. NeuroStars.org is a platform similar to
        StackOverflow but dedicated to neuroinformatics.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Debian-based systems
        --------------------
        
        On Debian-based systems, we recommend to enable
        `NeuroDebian <http://neuro.debian.net>`__ from which we provide recent
        releases of DataLad. Once enabled, just do:
        
        ::
        
           apt-get install datalad
        
        Other Linux’es, OSX via pip
        ---------------------------
        
        Before you install this package, please make sure that you `install a
        recent version of
        git-annex <https://git-annex.branchable.com/install>`__. Afterwards,
        install the latest version of ``datalad`` from
        `PyPi <https://pypi.org/project/datalad>`__. It is recommended to use a
        dedicated `virtualenv <https://virtualenv.pypa.io>`__:
        
        ::
        
           # create and enter a new virtual environment (optional)
           virtualenv --python=python3 ~/env/datalad
           . ~/env/datalad/bin/activate
        
           # install from PyPi
           pip install datalad
        
        By default, installation via pip installs core functionality of datalad
        allowing for managing datasets etc. Additional installation schemes are
        available, so you could provide enhanced installation via
        ``pip install datalad[SCHEME]`` where ``SCHEME`` could be
        
        -  ``tests`` to also install dependencies used by unit-tests battery of
           the datalad
        -  ``full`` to install all dependencies.
        
        There is also a `Singularity container <http://singularity.lbl.gov>`__
        available. The latest release version can be obtained by running:
        
        ::
        
           singularity pull shub://datalad/datalad
