Description: AWS Instance Information
        ========================
        
        
        Summary
        -------
        awsi script can help search for a server in aws and connect to it.
        
        It uses boto to connect to AWS and build a register of all the ec2 instances you have access too.
        
        It can generate a cache of all servers in the configured regions by calling <code>awsi --refresh</code>
        
        It can then connect to an instance using the instanceId, public ip address or name tag
        If more than one server is found (maybe they have the same name) it will show you all of them and require you to use a different
        piece of information. ID is unique so this is recommended.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        pip install awsi
        
        Configuration
