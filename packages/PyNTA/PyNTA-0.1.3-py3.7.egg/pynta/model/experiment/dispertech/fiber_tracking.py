"""
    Tracking in Hollow Optical Fibers
    =================================

    This experiment is very similar to the nanoparticle tracking experiment, but everything happens inside a hollow
    optical fiber. Some steps are different; for example, the user first has to focus the image of the camera on the
    top part of the setup in order to couple the laser to the optical fiber. Then, the user needs to maximise the
    background signal on the microscope's camera in order to fine-tune the coupling.

    The measurement is essentially a 1-D measurement of diffusion, in which equations need to be adapted for including
    diffusion in a cylinder.
