    ==============
    Running the acquisition on a separate thread gives a lot of flexibility when designing the program. It comes,
    however with some potential risks. First, threads are still running on the same Python interpreter. Therefore they
    do not overcome the GIL limitations. They are able to share memory, which makes them transparent to less experienced
    users. Potentially, different threads will access the same resources (i.e. devices) creating a clash. It is hard to
    implement semaphores or locks for every possible scenario, especially with devices such as cameras which can run
    without user intervention for long periods of time.
