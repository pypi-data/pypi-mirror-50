    ==========

    Base driver for communicating with Arduino devices. In principle, Arduino's can be programmed in very different
    ways, and therefore the flow of information may be very different. This driver is thought to interface with
    an Arduino which is in control of two DC motors and which is able to read values from some devices, such as a
    DHT22, and a DS18B20.
