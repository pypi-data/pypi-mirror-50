A Lexer for pygments that handles how Maxima (a Computer Algebra System) code
is highlighted.

> This package based on the `asymptote` lexer which is also a good option!

# Installation

You should be easilly install the package using the command (This package
obviously depends on `pygments`):

```bash
$ sudo pip install maximalexer
```

The package contains a basic test file that you can process:

```
$ pygmentize -f html -O full -o /tmp/example.html tests/examplefiles/basic.mac
$ firefox /tmp/example.html
```

# Usage

Just like any other pygments lexer, you can highlight Maxima code (not lisp)
using `pygmentize` command, `minted` latex package, `jekyll`, and so on.
