# Jupyter template

A simple template for jupyter notebooks.

The extension sets up a new Jupyter Notebook 
with a conventional and general-purpose
template to shape Data Science analysis. 
Moreover, adds a cell with commonly used imports, 
and prompts for a notebook name. 
Quite annoyingly.
