This is a simple library of wrapper functions for accessing the most common Apex API 2.0
requests.
The included functions are createCardTransaction, captureCardTransaction, refundCardTransaction, cancelCardTransaction and hostedPaymentPage. Each of
These functions is associated with an API request of the same name. The parameters
listed for each API call are the same as those for the associated functions; view 
The documentation for a more in-depth look at the parameters for each function.
