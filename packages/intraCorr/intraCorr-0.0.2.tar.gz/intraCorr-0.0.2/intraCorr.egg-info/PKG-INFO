Description: # Correlation for Repeated Observation within Subjects in Python
        
        This package applied the statistical technique for estimating the correlation for paired measures assessed on two or more ocassions for multiple subjects.
        Pearson correlation is applied when each paired of measurements is independent of one another. This is not the case when you have an observation for the same subject at different times.
