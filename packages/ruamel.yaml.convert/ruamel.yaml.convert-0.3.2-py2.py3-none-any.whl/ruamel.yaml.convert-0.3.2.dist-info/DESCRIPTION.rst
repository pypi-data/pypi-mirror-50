format conversion routines to/from YAML
=======================================

The conversion process from other formats requires additional packages.
These are not installed by default. To install all packages do::

    pip install ruamel.yaml.convert[all]

Instead of ``all`` you can provide ``html``, ``csv``, to install
only the dependencies needed for those formats.
