Description: # codimage
        
        codimage is a Python library that encrypts single / multiple text-transferable files, i.e. Python scripts, batch scripts and configuration files, into a single picture and protect your information with password.
        
        ## Overview
        
        #### File encryption
        
        Given a single / multiple files, a **PNG** image (your own selfies will also work!), and a user defined password, codimage will generate a **PNG** image that is nearly identical to the original one with all contents from the files to be encrypted into the pixels. 
        
        #### File decryption
        
        To decrypt and reverse back files from the code embedded image, user needs to use the original image and the correct password. 
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install codimage
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        #### Single file encryption
        
        ```python
        from codimage import codimage
        
        codimage = codimage.Codimage()
        codimage.encrypt(r"D:\dummy\dummy.png",
                         r"D:\codes\test.py",
                         r"D:\dummy\code.png",
                         "P@ssw0rd1")
        ```
        
        #### Multiple files encryption
        
        assume files to be encrypted are in D:\codes folder
        
        ```python
        codimage.encrypt(r"D:\dummy\dummy.png",
                         r"D:\codes",
                         r"D:\dummy\code.png",
                         "P@ssw0rd1")
        ```
        
        #### Image decryption
        
        assume files are to be exported to D:\export-codes
        
        ```python
        codimage.decrypt(r"D:\dummy\dummy.png",
                         r"D:\dummy\code.png",
                         r"D:\export-codes",
                         "P@ssw0rd1")
        ```
        
        After decryption,  a folder named 'codimage-*datetime*' will be created in export-codes with all files inside
