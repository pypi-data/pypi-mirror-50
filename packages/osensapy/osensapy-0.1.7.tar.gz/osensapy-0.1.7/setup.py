PyPi upload procedure

1. Install twine: 
      pip install twine

2. Build and package code: 
      python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
   Typically pip will install this version but will fall back to the source distribution if needed.
    - sdist: creates a source distribution 
    - bdist_wheel: creates a built distribution. 

3. Test upload to TestPyPi server:
      twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/* (if dist only contains latest distribution packages)
        or
      twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/osensapy-0.1.5* (replace with current version number)

4. Verify by installing library from TestPyPi:
      pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ osensapy

5. Upload to actual PyPi:
      twine upload dist/* (if dist only contains latest distribution packages)
        or
      twine upload dist/osensapy-0.1.5* (replace with current version number)
