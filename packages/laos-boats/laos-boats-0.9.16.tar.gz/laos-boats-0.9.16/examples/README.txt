README file in boss/examples

Example input files and user functions are located in the directories
examples/input_files and examples/user_functions.

To run them all along with some tests run the shell script (takes about 10 minutes):

./run_tests.sh

The results will go to the directory examples/test_results.
Although the script already does some checking, one can also manually
compare the obtained results to provided "answers" at examples/correct_results.

If you wish to clean the directory, type:

./clean.sh
