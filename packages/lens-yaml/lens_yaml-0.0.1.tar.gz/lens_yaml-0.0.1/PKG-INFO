Description: # lens\_yaml
        
        A [lens](https://github.com/port-zero/lens) plugin for [YAML](https://yaml.org/).
        
        It understands and pretty-prints YAML.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```
        pip install lens_yaml
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        The plugin will be picked up by lens immediately as a format.
        There is nothing you need to do for it to work.
