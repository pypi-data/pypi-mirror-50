Description: Introduction
        ============
        
        The IETF_ uses a specific format for the standards and other documents it
        publishes as RFCs_, and for the draft documents which are produced when
        developing documents for publications.  There exists a number of different
        tools to facilitate the formatting of drafts and RFCs according to the
        existing rules, and this tool, **xml2rfc**, is one of them.  It takes as input
        an xml file which contains the text and meta-information about author names
        etc., and transforms it into suitably formatted output.  The input xml file
        should follow the grammars in RFC7749_ (for v2 documents) or RFC7991_ (for 
        v3 documents). Note that the grammar for v3 is still being refined, and 
        changes will eventually be captured in the `bis draft for 7991`_. 
        Changes not yet captured can be seen in the xml2rfc source `v3.rng`_.
        
        **xml2rfc** provides a variety of output formats. See the command line
        help for a full list of formats. It also provides conversion from v2 to
        v3, and can run the preptool_ on its input.

        Installation
        ============
        
        Installation of the python package is done as usual with 'pip install xml2rfc',
        using appropriate switches and/or sudo.
        
        Installation of support libraries for the PDF-formatter
        -------------------------------------------------------
        
        In order to generate PDFs, xml2rfc uses the WeasyPrint module, which
        depends on external libaries that must be installed as native packages
        on your platform, separately from the xml2rfc install.
        
        First, install the Cairo, Pango, and GDK-PixBuf library files on your
        system.  See installation instructions on the WeasyPrint Docs:
        
            https://weasyprint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install.html
        
        (Python 3 is not needed if your system Python is 2.7, though).
        
        (On some OS X systems with System Integrity Protection active, you may
        need to create a symlink from your home directory to the library installation
        directory (often /opt/local/lib):
        
            ln -s /opt/local/lib ~/lib
        
        in order for weasyprint to find the installed cairo and pango libraries.
        Whether this is needed or not depends on whether you used macports or homebrew
        to install cairo and pango, and the homebrew / macport version.)
        
        Next, install the pycairo and weasyprint python modules using pip.
        Depending on your system, you may need to use 'sudo' or install in
        user-specific directories, using the --user switch.  On OS X in
        particular, you may also need to install a newer version of setuptools
        using --user before weasyprint can be installed.  If you install with 
        the --user switch, you may need to also set PYTHONPATH, e.g.,
        
            PYTHONPATH=/Users/henrik/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages
        
        for Python 2.7.
        
        The basic pip commands (modify as needed according to the text above)
        are:
        
            pip install 'pycairo>=1.18' 'weasyprint<=0.42.3'
        
        With these installed and available to xml2rfc, the --pdf switch will be
        enabled.
        
        For PDF output, you also need to install the Noto font set.  Download the full
        set from https://noto-website-2.storage.googleapis.com/pkgs/Noto-unhinted.zip,
        and install as appropriate for your platform.
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        xml2rfc accepts a single XML document as input and outputs to one or more conversion formats.
        
        **Basic Usage**: ``xml2rfc SOURCE [options] FORMATS...``
        
        Run ``xml2rfc --help`` for a full listing of command-line options.

        Version 2.24.0 (10 Aug 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release addresses a number of issues and minor feature requests from
          the RFC Editor.  Excerpt from the commit log:
        
          * Added a switch --rfc-reference-base-url to specify an alternative base url
            when using <xref> section links.
        
          * Stabilized XML and HTML output attribute order.  With lxml 4.40, the
            handling of attribute order changed for Py 3.6 and higher, to match the
            use of ordered dictionaries in Py3.6+.  Initial attributes set on an
            element are now sorted by key value.  This matches what lxml did
            previously, and still does for Py 2.7 and Py 3.[0-5].  Enforcing sorted
            initial attributes under Py 3.6+ makes our output more stable under
            varying versions of lxml and Python.
        
          * Added support for <xref> section references in the v3 text formatter.
            Refactored some of the xref handling in preptool.  Added warnings for some
            xref attribute and content combinations that don't make sense.
        
          * Tweaked the error message for use of -o with multiple output formats.
        
          * Tweaked the layout of v3 text front page to correctly handle unicode
            codepoints of different width than 1, in order to get correct line lengths
            for authors with CJK names.
        
          * Handled a problem with an unwanted space between year and the following
            comma in HTML <reference><date> rendering.
        
          * When using the built-in lxml Element remove() method, it unexpectedly
            removes not only the element, but also the element's tail.  Dealt with
            this by using our own remove() where needed.
        
          * Added pilcrows on <dd>, to match pilcrows on other list entries.
        
          * Removed address lines with only punctuation from the author address
            rendering, eliminating for instance lines containing only a comma.
        
          * Added a viewport meta tag, to improve rendering on some devices.
        
          * Added class 'selfRef' on some Figure and Table links that were missing it.
        
          * Changed the address format to always start with the author name, according
            to a conversation with the RFC-Editor staff in Prague.
        
          * Changed the V3 writer note() method to obey quiet and verbose in the same
            manner as log.note().
        
          * Changed the v3 validate() from being separate methods for the v2v3
            converter and the preptool to a common method on BaseV3Writer.
        
          * Tweaked the <date> handling to make year ranges and fuzzy dates possible.
        
          * Fixed an issue where text was lost when immediately preceded by <xref>.
        
          * Added a --bom text format option, to insert a BOM mark at the beginning of
            the text format output.  Also added a BOM test, and removed some
            irrelevant switches.
        
          * Made the line spacing of <sourcecode> the same as for <artwork>.
        
          * Removed stripping of horizontal whitespace at the start of artwork in list
            items.
        
          * Removed an unwanted attribute inheritance of 'ulEmpty' for <ul>.
        
          * Fixed an issue with the CSS stylesheet for compact <dl> lists.
        
          * Removed an unintentional change that would permit a 'contributor' author
            role.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.23.1 (07 Jul 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          * Fixed a bug in the handling of sha1 and base64 methods when generating 
            cache names for references with query arguments.
        
          * Updated the license file to more strictly follow the BSD 3-Clause 
            license, and changed the license field in the setup.py file to be more 
            precise.
        
        
        
        
        
        
        
        Version 2.23.0 (27 Jun 2019)
        ------------------------------------------------
        
        
          This release adds v2v3 support for conversion of v2 code with both text and
          external image sources to v3 <artset> format, and provides improved cache
          handling.  It also contains a long list of bugfixes.  Here is an excerpt
          from the commit log:
        
          * Fixed an issue where cache clearing did not consider custom cache 
            locations.
        
          * Added retry on connection error for external includes.  This fixes an
            issue which has appearing more often recently, where the first connection
            to fetch a reference file has failed to provide the right redirect.
        
          * Added inclusion of metadata.js in the html renderer, for future handling
            of dynamic metadata (updated-by and obsoleted-by information, for
            instance).  Added a default instance of the metadata javascript file to
            the distribution, and added an command-line option to specify an
            alternative version of the javascript metadata script.
        
          * Added <script> to the list of elements treated as blocks for HTML output
            formatting purposes.
        
          * Show 'US' as "United States of America" (official name rather than short 
            name according to ISO 3166-1)
        
          * Changed the default RFC base URL in run.py, and the extension used in 
            html.py.
        
          * Added code to the v2v3 converter to create an <artset> for legacy 
            artwork with both a 'src' attribute and text content.
        
          * Changed <reference> rendering when part of a <referencegroup> to not 
            include the DOI.
        
          * Fixed a crash that could occur during index building with multiple levels
            of <references>.
        
          * Tweaked the text format <artwork> placeholder (when no text format 
            artwork is present) to look at both 'src' and 'originalSrc' for an URL
            for alternative artwork.
        
          * Changed the handling of pilcrow links at end of paragraphs and similar 
            to follow immediately after the content, without wrappable space, to avoid 
            the appearence of having double blandk lines when the pilcrow would be 
            wrapped to sit by itself on a line.
        
          * Added a HTML div to hold artset anchor, fixing an issue where artset
            anchors would not always be present.
        
          * Refined the preptool warnings regarding artset/artwork anchor handling.
        
          * Eliminated toc update work when tocInclude is false.
        
          * Only apply validation of cache entries as references if they are 
            <reference> entries.
        
          * Refined the reference URL cache handling for URLs with query arguments, 
            to avoid cache collisions.
        
          * Eliminated an incorrect check for page break after section header at end
            of document.  Fixes issue #409.
        
          * Handled authors without address elements for v3 text.  Fixes issue #408.
        
          * Dealt better with <workgroup> without content.
        
          * Changed the schema to require at least one instance of <artwork> within 
            <artset>.  Fixes issue #405.
        
          * Added a default rendering (code point number) for code points without 
            unicode code point names.  Fixes issues #401 and #402.
