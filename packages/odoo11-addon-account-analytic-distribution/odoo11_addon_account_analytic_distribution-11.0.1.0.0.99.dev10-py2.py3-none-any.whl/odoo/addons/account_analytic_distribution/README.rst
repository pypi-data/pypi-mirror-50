Analytic accounting helps you to analyze costs and revenues in your company.
Analytic analysis allows you to answer specific business questions and
forecast possible future financial scenarios.

In Odoo, analytic accounts are linked to general accounts but are treated
totally independently. So, you can enter various different analytic operations
that have no counterpart in the general financial accounts.

By default, you can enter only one analytic account for each journal item and
only one analytic line it will be created.

With this module, you can define an analytic distribution in every journal
item, so you can distribute total amount to several analytic accounts.

Configuration
=============

To configure your analytic distributions go to:

#. *Invoicing > Configuration > Settings* and activate checkbox **Analytic
   accounting** in *Accounting & Finance*.
#. Now you see the menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Analytic Accounting >
   Analytic Distributions*
#. Create a new analytic distribution and enter its name
#. Add some distribution rules: you must specify the analytic account and
   percentage of total move line amount you want to distribute.
#. Save distribution.
#. You can set if sum of total percent of analytic accounts must be 100% or
   not by company. If yo go to your company settings, you can find a checkbox
   **Force percent** in *General Information* tab.

Usage
=====

After installation, you'll see a new 'Analytic Distribution' column in
Journal Entry form (in Journal Items tab), in order to select the
analytic distribution you want when creating journal entries manually. You
can do the same in account invoice form and select your analytic distribution
in invoice lines.

Multiple analytic lines are created when the invoice or the entries are
confirmed.

You can continue using 'Analytic Account' field, but 'Analytic Distribution'
has precedence if defined.
