Analytic accounting helps you to analyze costs and revenues in your company.
Analytic analysis allows you to answer specific business questions and
forecast possible future financial scenarios.

In Odoo, analytic accounts are linked to general accounts but are treated
totally independently. So, you can enter various different analytic operations
that have no counterpart in the general financial accounts.

By default, you can enter only one analytic account for each journal item and
only one analytic line it will be created.

With this module, you can define an analytic distribution in every journal
item, so you can distribute total amount to several analytic accounts.
