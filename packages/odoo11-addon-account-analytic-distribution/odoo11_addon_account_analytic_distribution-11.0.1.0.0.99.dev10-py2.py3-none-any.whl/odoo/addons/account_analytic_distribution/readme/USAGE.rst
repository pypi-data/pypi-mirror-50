After installation, you'll see a new 'Analytic Distribution' column in
Journal Entry form (in Journal Items tab), in order to select the
analytic distribution you want when creating journal entries manually. You
can do the same in account invoice form and select your analytic distribution
in invoice lines.

Multiple analytic lines are created when the invoice or the entries are
confirmed.

You can continue using 'Analytic Account' field, but 'Analytic Distribution'
has precedence if defined.
