        # How it works
        
        
        Simply install from pip:
        
        ```
        pip install easymodels
        easymodels
        ```
        
        or clone this repo and run:
        ```
        python setup.py install
        easymodels
        ```
        
        This will bring up a command line tool that will guide you through grabbing whatever models are available through the modelzoo API.
