        Currently in late alpha. Basic functionality has been achieved!
        
        ## Installation
        
        For a development install (currently the only option), do the following in the repository directory:
        
        ```bash
        pip install .
        jlpm build:dev
        ```
        
        To watch for/rebuild on changes to this extension's source code, run:
        
        ```bash
        jlpm run build:watch
        ```
        
        ## What's in this extension
        
        This extension has two parts: an hdf5 filebrowser, and an hdf5 dataset file type.
        
        ### HDF5 Filebrowser
        
        Allows you to navigate an `.hdf5` file's groups as though they were directories in a filesystem. Any `.hdf5` file on a user's system can be opened by entering its path (relative to the Jupyterlab home directory) in the box at the top of the browser.
        
        ### HDF5 dataset file type
        
        When you open a dataset using the hdf5 filebrowser, a document will open that displays the contents of the dataset via a grid.
        
        ## Status of the latest version
        
        - filebrowser
        
          - works well, and allows you to open datasets via a double click. Some minor UI issues remain (mostly with the breadcrumbs and the `.hdf5` path input box).
        
        - dataset file type
          - currently, only the first 100x100 chunk of a dataset will load. The next goal of development is to enable dynamic loading of the rest of a dataset's chunks.
