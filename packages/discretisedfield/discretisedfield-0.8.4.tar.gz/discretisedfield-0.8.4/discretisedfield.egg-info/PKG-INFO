        ## About
        
        `discretisedfield` is a Python package that provides:
        
        - Creation of finite difference meshes
        
        - Creation, analysis, and plotting of finite difference fields
        
        - Reading and writing of different file types, such as `.ovf` and `.vtk`
        
        It is available on all major operating systems (Windows, MacOS, Linux) and requires Python 3.5 or higher.
        
        ## Installation
        
        We recommend installing `discretisedfield` by using either of the `pip` or `conda` package managers.
        
        #### Python requirements
        
        Before installing `discretisedfield` via `pip`, please make sure you have Python 3.5 or higher on your system. You can check that by running
        
            python3 --version
        
        If you are on Linux, it is likely that you already have Python installed. However, on MacOS and Windows, this is usually not the case. If you do not have Python 3.5 or higher on your machine, we strongly recommend installing the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python distribution. [Download Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) for your operating system and follow instructions on the download page. Further information about installing Anaconda can be found [here](https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/install/download.html).
        
        #### `pip`
        
        After installing Anaconda on MacOS or Windows, `pip` will also be installed. However, on Linux, if you do not already have `pip`, you can install it with
        
            sudo apt install python3-pip
        
        To install the `discretisedfield` version currently in the Python Package Index repository [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/discretisedfield/) on all operating systems run:
        
            python3 -m pip install discretisedfield
        
        #### `conda`
        
        `discretisedfield` is installed using `conda` by running
        
            conda install --channel conda-forge discretisedfield
        
        For further information on the `conda` package, dependency, and environment management, please have a look at its [documentation](https://conda.io/docs/). 
        
        ## Updating
        
        If you used pip to install `discretisedfield`, you can update to the latest released version in [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/discretisedfield/) by running
        
            python3 -m pip install --upgrade discretisedfield
        
        On the other hand, if you used `conda` for installation, update `discretisedfield` with
        
            conda upgrade discretisedfield
        
        #### Development version
        
        The most recent development version of `discretisedfield` that is not yet released can be installed/updated with
        
            git clone https://github.com/ubermag/discretisedfield.git
            python3 -m pip install --upgrade discretisedfield
        
        **Note**: If you do not have `git` on your system, it can be installed by following the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).
        
        ## Binder
        
        `discretisedfield` can be used in the cloud via Binder. This does not require you to have anything installed and no files will be created on your machine. To use `discretisedfield` in the cloud, follow this [link](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ubermag/discretisedfield/master?filepath=index.ipynb).
        
        ## Documentation
        
        Documentation for `discretisedfield` is available [here](http://discretisedfield.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest), where APIs and tutorials (in the form of Jupyter notebooks) are available.
