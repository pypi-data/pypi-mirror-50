        # 👀 BONAPITY 👀
        
        `bonAPIty` is the simplest python3 package allowing you to create simple API 
        (GET & POST) for your functions without writting any complicated line of server code !
        
        You are the 👨‍🍳, just do what you do the best : cook code !
        don't loose your time to 💁, we do it for you... :)
        
        By type hinting your code we cast 
        the received inputs to the right type ! 
        so don't worry about it... 😀
        
        Even better, for each function generated a corresponding doc page is served 
        including auto-generated example of python and javascript to make things 
        easier to create a client for your API !
