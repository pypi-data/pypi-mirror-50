    Parameters:
        name: (`str`): Name of the macro function to run. This name
            is not case sensitive. Must be a non-zero length `str`.

        parameters: (`str`): Any parameters which the quick macro
            requires. Pass `None` (default) for macro functions which require no
            parameters. The parameters are passed as a string which includes
            the parenthesis. For example, if the macro function takes a
            string parameter and int parameter, pass
            **'("string_parameter_name", 2)'** Default: `None`

    Macro functions must be defined before they are used. Typically they
    are defined in the 'tecplot.mcr' configuration file which is read
    when |Tecplot Engine| is initialized. Macro functions
    may also be available in the Quick Macro Panel when the Tecplot 360 GUI
    is running.

    .. note::
        See the |Tecplot Macro Scripting Guide| for more information about
        macro functions.

    Run the "Tile Frames" macro functions. This macro function is defined in
    the file "tecplot.mcr", which is located in the Tecplot 360
    installation directory::

    Run a macro function named "Calculate" which takes no parameters and
    another macro function called "Display" which takes the name of a
    layout file and an integer as parameters::

        >>> tp.macro.execute_function('Calculate')
        >>> tp.macro.execute_function('Display', '("contour.lay", 2)')

    .. warning:: Zero-based Indexing

        It is important to know that all indexing in |PyTecplot| scripts are
        zero-based. This is a departure from the macro language which is
        one-based. This is to keep with the expectations when working in the
        python language. However, |PyTecplot| does not modify strings that are
        passed to the |Tecplot Engine|. This means that one-based indexing
        should be used when running macro commands from python or when using
        `execute_equation() <tecplot.data.operate.execute_equation>`.

    This command splits the input into individual commands and runs them one
    at a time. See the |Tecplot Macro Scripting Guide| for details about
    |Tecplot 360|'s macro language.

    .. warning::
        The $!VARSET command is not supported. Tecplot Macro variables should be
        converted to Python variables.

    .. warning::
        Intrinsic variables (that is, variables with pipes such as
        ``|DATASETFNAME|``) are not supported. If you need to use an intrinsic
        variable in the macro command, add the macro command to a text file and
        call `execute_file`.

    See the |Tecplot Macro Scripting Guide| for more information about raw data
    and intrinsic variables.

    The following command will perform the same operations as the
    `Hello, World! example <hello_world>`::

        >>> tecplot.macro.execute_command(r'''

        command_processor_id (`str`):  A unique string used to
            determine the API to call when an extended macro command is
            processed. API's are provided by add-ons or applications
            that extend the Tecplot macro language.

            Typically this will be the name of an add-on or application,
            followed by a version number. For example: 'CFDAnalyzer4'.

            Each application or add-on may provide one or more unique
            command processor ID strings corresponding to different API's,
            or different versions of an API.

            For example, a file converter add-on responsible
            for converting DXF files for Tecplot might provide two versions
            of an API:
            "DXFCONVERTTOOL-1.2", and "DXFCONVERTTOOL-2.0".
            In that case either of these strings would be passed in the
            *command_processor_id* parameter to indicate the version of the
            API to use.

        command (`str`): The command to run.
        raw_data (`str`): Raw data required for the command, if any
            (default: `None`).

    .. note:: **Absolute and relative paths with PyTecplot**

        Relative paths, when used within the PyTecplot API are always from
        Python's current working directory which can be obtained by calling
        :func:`os.getcwd()`. This is true for batch and `connected
        <tecplot.session.connect()>` modes. One exception to this is paths
        within a macro command or file which will be relative to the |Tecplot
        Engine|'s home directory, which is typically the |Tecplot 360|
        installation directory. Finally, when connected to a remote (non-local)
        instance of Tecplot 360, only absolute paths are allowed.

        Note that backslashes must be escaped which is especially important for
        windows paths such as ``"C:\\\\Users"`` or ``"\\\\\\\\server\\\\path"``
        which will resolve to ``"C:\\Users"`` and ``"\\\\server\\path"``
        respectively. Alternatively, one may use Python's raw strings:
        ``r"C:\\Users"`` and ``r"\\\\server\\path"``
