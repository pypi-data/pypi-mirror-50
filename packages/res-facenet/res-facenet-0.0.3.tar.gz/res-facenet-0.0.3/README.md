# ResFacenet
This package is intended as an __pytorch hub__ entry point for my trained facenet model on this repo [khrlimam/facenet](https://github.com/khrlimam/facenet).
This pretrained model can be used for anyone who want to use it for transfer learning or any other applications.

This model trained on VGGv2 dataset and tested on LFW dataset and gained 92% accuracy.
