# scikit-allel (version 2.x)

Functions for exploratory analysis of genome variation data.

This is work in progress. For scikit-allel version 1.x, please see the
[cggh/scikit-allel](https://github.com/cggh/scikit-allel) repository.

Please note that this is a meta-package providing convenient access to
functions from several packages via a single namespace. If you would
like to propose or add new functionality, please see the following
packages:

* [skallel-tensor](https://github.com/scikit-allel/skallel-tensor)
* [skallel-stats](https://github.com/scikit-allel/skallel-stats)
* skallel-io (TODO)
