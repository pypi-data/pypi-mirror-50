        About
        -----
        
        **OlaPy** is an OLAP_ engine based on Python, which gives you a set of tools for the development of reporting and analytical
        applications, multidimensional analysis, and browsing of aggregated data with MDX_ and XMLA_ support.

        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install from PyPI
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        You can install it directly from the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/olapy>`_::
        
            pip install olapy
        
        
        Install from Github
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The project sources are stored in `Github repository <https://github.com/abilian/olapy>`_.
        
        Download from Github::
        
            git clone git://github.com/abilian/olapy.git
        
        
        To set up the application, run, ideally in a virtualenv::
        
            cd olapy
            python setup.py install
        
        or just::
        
            pip install -e .
        
        **[OPTIONAL]**
        
        you can use `Spark <https://spark.apache.org/docs/0.9.0/python-programming-guide.html>`_  instead of `Pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_, to do so, you need just to install it::
        
            pip install pyspark
        
        and if you want to go back to pandas just uninstall spark with::
        
            pip uninstall pyspark
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        Before running OlaPy, you need to initialize it with::
        
            olapy init
        
        and then you can run the server with::
        
            olapy runserver
        
        
        and then from excel, open new spreadsheet and go to : Data -> From Other Sources -> From Analysis Services and use http://127.0.0.1:8000/ as server name and click next, then you can chose one of default olapy demo cubes (sales, foodmart...) and finish.
        
        that's it ! now you can play with data
