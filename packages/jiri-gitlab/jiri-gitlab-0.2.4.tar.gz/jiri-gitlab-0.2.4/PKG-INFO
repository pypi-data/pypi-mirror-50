Description: # jiri-gitlab
        
        This is a small utility that creates a [jiri manifest file](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/jiri/) 
        from Gitlab projects.
        
        Use this if you want a complete and updated set of repositories from your private gitlab instance 
        on your machine.
        
        ## Install
        
        `pip3 install --user jiri-gitlab`
        
        ## Instructions
        
        Ensure you've followed [the Jiri bootstrapping guide](https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/jiri/#quickstart).
        
        Then, create a file called `~/.python-gitlab.cfg` in your home directory and add:
        
        ```cfg
        [company-name-here]
        url = https://your-gitlab-url/
        private_token = your-private-token
        
        ```
        
        You need to create a private token with read access to your repositories.
        
        Once you've done that, run:
        
        ```
        cd $MY_ROOT # Or wherever you've defined your project directory to be
        jiri-gitlab --auth company-name-here "*" > .jiri_manifest
        ```
        
        This will produce an XML file that Jiri can consume to pull all your projects:
        
        ```
        jiri update -gc=true
        ```
        
        There is also a utility tool to list projects:
        
        ```
        jiri-list ~/projects/.jiri_manifest
        ```
        
        You can combine this with `fzf` for quick project navigation:
        
        ```
        jiri-list ~/projects/.jiri_manifest | fzf --ansi --preview "mdcat {}/README.md"
        ```
