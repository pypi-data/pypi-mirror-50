class Indicator:
    """
    Base class extended by all supported animated indicators

    Attributes
    ----------
    name : str
        the name of the task covered by the animation
    color : str
        unimplemented - will be the color of the animation
    animation_thread : threading.Thread
        the thread that allows the animation to run even while script processes in the background
    is_running : bool
        boolean saying if animation is running
    item_counter : int
        counter representing which task is being worked on
    num_elems : int
        number of tasks to complete
    chars_written : int
        number of chars written for the animation in the previous line
    writing : bool
        a toggle to see if the indicator is writing or not

    Methods
    -------
    start()
        starts the animation
    animate()
        function that needs to be implemented by each extension of this base class
    stop()
        function that stops the animation
    write()
        function used to actually write the animation to stdout
    increment_counter()
        increments the completed item counter
