    """ Describes the creation of the logical file.

    Origin objects is an unique indentifier for a Logical File and it
    describes the circumstances under which the file was created. The Origin
    object also spesify the Logical File's relation to a DLIS-file and to
    which Logical Set it belongs.

    A logical file may have several Origin objects, whereas the first Origin
    object is the Defining object. No two logical files should have identical
    Defining Origins.

    Notes
    -----

    The Origin object reflects the logical record type ORIGIN, defined in rp66.
    ORIGIN records are listed in Appendix A.2 - Logical Record Types and
    described in detail in Chapter 5.1 - Static and Frame Data, Origin objects.
