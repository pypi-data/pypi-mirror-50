Module Structure
================

`sbpy` consists of a number of modules, each of which is set up as a
class structure to encapsulate functionality and allow the user to
deal with a relatively small set of top-level functions. The general
module design is shown in the following sketch.

   `sbpy` design schematic. Modules are shown as rectangular boxes,
   important classes as rounded colored boxes. The left-hand side of
   the schematic is mainly populated with support modules that act as
   data containers and query functions. The right-hand side of the
   schematic shows modules that focus on small body-related
   functionality. Colored symbols match the colors and symbols of
   classes and modules they are using.

The expected functionality of the individual package modules is
detailed below.

   
`sbpy.data`
-----------

The `~sbpy.data` module provides data containers used throughout
`sbpy` for orbital elements (`~sbpy.data.Orbit`), ephemerides and
observations (`~sbpy.data.Ephem`), physical properties
(`~sbpy.data.Phys`), and target names (`~sbpy.data.Names`). Instances
of these classes are used as input to a wide range of top-level
functions throughout `sbpy`, guaranteeing a consistent and
user-friendly API. All classes in `~sbpy.data` provide query functions
to obtain relevant information from web-based services such as `JPL
Horizons`_, `Minor Planet Center`_ (MPC), `IMCCE`_, and `Lowell
Observatory`_, providing orbital elements at different epochs,
ephemerides, physical properties, (alternative) target identifiers
etc. Please refer to the `github wiki`_ for examples.

Additional functionality of `~sbpy.data` includes: an interface for
ephemerides calculations to `PyEphem`_; an interface to the `REBOUND`_
(Rein and Liu 2012) package for orbital integration; a wrapper for the
orbit fitting software `OpenOrb`_; an interface to SPICE for offline
ephemerides calculations using `SpiceyPy`_, for which we will provide
utilities tailored to the needs of the small body community;
transformations between orbital elements, state vectors, physical
properties, and naming conventions.

`~sbpy.data` also provides a range of other useful module-level
functions: `~sbpy.data.mpc_observations` enables the user to query all
observations reported to the MPC for a given target. `~sbpy.data.image_search`
queries the `Solar System Object Image Search function of the
Canadian Astronomy Data Centre`_, providing a table of images that
may contain the target based on its ephemerides. `~sbpy.data.sb_search` uses
IMCCEâ€™s `Skybot`_; given a registered FITS image, the function will
search for small bodies that might be present in the image based on
their ephemerides. `~sbpy.data.pds_ferret` queries the `Small Bodies Data
Ferret`_ at the Planetary Data Systems Small Bodies Node for all
existing information on a specific small body in the PDS. 


`sbpy.activity`
---------------

The `~sbpy.activity` module provides classes for modeling cometary
comae, tails, and ice sublimation, and functions for working with
cometary absolute magnitudes and photometry (e.g., the Afrho parameter
of A'Hearn et al. 1984). We implement a gas coma class that will use
Haser (`~sbpy.activity.Haser`, Haser 1957) and Vectorial
(`~sbpy.activity.Vectorial`, Festou 1981) models for gas comae, including
parameters for commonly observed molecules (e.g., H2O, CO2 , CO, OH,
CN, C2 ; A'Hearn et al. 1995; Debout et al. 2016). Independent of the
model, the gas coma class can be used to generate aperture photometry
or a synthetic image of the comet. For dust, we integrate a
syndyne/synchrone model (`~sbpy.activity.Syndynes`, Finson & Probstein 1968;
Kelley et al. 2013), and write a visualization plugin for the `Ginga
Image Viewer`_. The Cowan & A'Hearn (1979) ice sublimation model
(`~sbpy.activity.sublimation`), used to describe comet activity, and common
parameters will be incorporated, too.


`sbpy.photometry`
-----------------

The `~sbpy.photometry` module implements a number of light scattering
models for asteroidal surfaces and cometary coma dust. The goal of
this module is to provide a facility to fit light scattering models to
observed brightness data of asteroids, and to estimate the brightness
of asteroids and cometary comae under specified geometry based on
scattering models.  Specifically, we include a number of
disk-integrated phase function models for asteroids, bidirectional
reflectance (I/F) models of particulate surfaces, and phase functions
of dust grains in cometary comae. The disk-integrated phase function
models of asteroids include the IAU adopted (H, G1 , G2) system
(Muinonen et al. 2010), the simplified (H, G12) system (Muinonen et
al. 2010), as well as the outdated IAU (H, G) system. The
disk-resolved bidirectional reflectance model includes a number of
models that have been widely used in the small bodies community, such
as the Lommel-Seeliger model, Lambert model, Lunar-Lambert model,
etc. Surface facet geometries used in the different models can be
derived with methods in `~sbpy.shape`. We also include the most
commonly used 5-parameter version of the Hapke scattering
model. Empirical cometary dust phase functions are implemented, too
(Marcus 2007; Schleicher & Bair 2011,
http://asteroid.lowell.edu/comet/dustphase.html).  Some
single-scattering phase functions such as the Henyey-Greenstein
function will also be implemented.


`sbpy.shape`
------------

The `~sbpy.shape` module provides tools for the use of 3D shape models
of small bodies and the analysis of lightcurve observations. The user
can load asteroid shapes saved in a number of common formats, such as
VRML, OBJ, into `~sbpy.shape.Kaasalainen`, and then calculate the geometry
of illumination and view for its surface facets, and manipulate
it. Furthermore, `~sbpy.shape.Kaasalainen` will provide methods for
lightcurve inversion. `~sbpy.shape` will provide an interface to use
shape models for functions in `~sbpy.photometry`.

In addition to the shape model methods, `~sbpy.shape` also provides
methods for the analysis and simulation of simple lightcurve data. The
`~sbpy.shape.Lightcurve` class provides routines to fit rotational period
(based on Lomb-Scargle routines implemented in astropy.stats and other
frequency tools), Fourier coefficients, and spin pole axis
orientation. The class will also be able to simulate a lightcurve at
specified epochs with a shape model class and the associated
information such as pole orientation, illumination and viewing
geometry as provided by the `~sbpy.data.Phys` class, and a scattering model
provided through classes defined in the `~sbpy.photometry` module.


`sbpy.spectroscopy`
-------------------

As part of `~sbpy.spectroscopy`, we provide routines for fitting
measured spectra, as well as simulating synthetic spectra over a wide
range of the electromagnetic spectrum.  The spectral models include
emission lines relevant to observations of comet comae, as well as
reflectance spectra of asteroid and comet surfaces. The module
provides functions to fit and remove baselines or slopes, as well as
to fit emission lines or reflectance spectra. 

The spectroscopy module includes LTE and non-LTE radiative transfer
models used to determine production rates and excitation parameters,
such as the temperature in the coma. In the inner regions of the coma
collisions dominate molecular excitation and the resulting rotational
level population is close to LTE. Beyond the LTE inner region, the
level populations start to depart from the equilibrium distribution
because the gas density is not high enough to reach thermodynamic
equilibrium through collisions with neutrals. The inclusion of all
relevant excitation processes in cometary atmospheres in a complex
3-dimensional outgassing geometry represents a state-of-the-art coma
model which will provide a baseline for interpretation of cometary
spectroscopy observations. Most of the codes required for the model
have already been developed and will be included in a self-consistent
model for this project.

In addition to the aforementioned functionality, we provide a class
`~sbpy.spectroscopy.Hapke` that implements Hapke spectral mixing
functionality.

This module also provides spectrophotometry methods as part of
`~sbpy.spectroscopy.Spectrophotometry`. This functionality includes the
convolution of common photometric filters with spectra generated by
this module or literature spectra of small bodies or stars and the
derivation of photometric colors from spectral slopes. 


`sbpy.thermal`
--------------

Thermal modeling capabilities for asteroids are available through the
`~sbpy.thermal` module.  The module provides implementations of the
Standard Thermal Model (`~sbpy.thermal.STM`, Morrison & Lebofsky
1979), the Fast-Rotating Model (`~sbpy.thermal.FRM`, Lebofsky &
Spencer 1989), and the popular Near-Earth Asteroid Thermal Model
(`~sbpy.thermal.NEATM`, Harris 1998) which can all be used in the same
way for estimating fluxes or fitting model solutions to observational
data.


`sbpy.imageanalysis`
--------------------

The `~sbpy.imageanalysis` module will focus on the analysis of
telescopic images. `~sbpy.imageanalysis.Centroid` provides a range of
centroiding methods, including a dedicated comet centroiding technique
that mitigates coma and tail biases (Tholen & Chesley 2004).  Code
will also be developed to incorporate ephemerides into FITS image
headers to facilitate image reprojection in the rest frame of the
moving target (`~imageanalysis.moving_wcs`) for image co-addition,
e.g., using SWARP (Bertin 2002). We will modify and integrate cometary
coma enhancement code from collaborator Samarasinha
(`~imageanalysis.CometaryEnhancements`; Samarasinha & Larson 2014;
Martin et al. 2015). The coma enhancements will be coded into a plugin
for the `Ginga Image Viewer`_.

`~sbpy.imageanalysis` will also provide PSF subtraction functionality
that is utilizing and extending the Astropy affiliated package
`photutils`_; this class will provide wrap- pers for photutils to
simplify the application for moving object observations. Results of
imageanalysis.PSFSubtraction routines can be directly used in
imageanalysis.Cometary- Enhancements for further analysis.


`sbpy.obsutil`
--------------

The `~sbpy.obsutil` module enables the user to conveniently check
observability of moving targets and to plan future observations. Using
`~spby.data.Ephem` functionality, `~sbpy.obsutil` provides tools to
identify peak observability over a range of time based on different
criteria, create observing scripts, plot quantities like airmass as a
function of time, and create finder charts for an individual
target. These functions and plots will be easily customizable and will
work identically for individual targets and large numbers of
targets. Finder charts will be produced from online sky survey data,
providing information on the target's track across the sky, it's
positional uncertainty, background stars with known magnitudes for
calibration purposes, and other moving objects.


`sbpy.bib`
----------

`~sbpy.bib` provides a unique feature that simplifies the
acknowledgment of methods and code utilized by the user. After
activating the bibliography tracker in `~sbpy.bib`, references and
citations of all functions used by the user are tracked in the
background. The user can request a list of references that should be
cited based on sbpy functionality that was used at any time as clear
text or in the LATeX BibTex format.
