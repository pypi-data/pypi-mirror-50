Description: 
        pyhepmc-ng is a wrapper of the HepMC-v3 C++ library.
        
        Another wrapper is [pyhepmc](https://pypi.org/project/pyhepmc/).
        Why should you use this one?
        
        **pyhepmc-ng is easy to install**
        
        The command `pip install pyhepmc-ng` just works! You only need a compiler that
        supports C++11, everything else is handled by pip.
        
        Under the hood, the bindings are build with the excellent
        [pybind11](http://pybind11.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) library.
        pybind11 is automatically installed as a requirement by pip. You don't need an
        external installation of the HepMC library, either. A copy of this
        light-weight library is included.
        
        **pyhepmc-ng is actively developed**
        
        pyhepmc-ng is part of the Scikit-HEP project, which aims to provide all tools needed by particle physicists to do data analysis in Python.
        
        **pyhepmc-ng is unit tested**
        
        Everything in pyhepmc-ng is unit tested.
        
        **pyhepmc-ng supports Pythonic code**
        
        pyhepmc-ng is a hand-crafted mapping of C++ code to Python. It supports Python idioms
        where appropriate.
        
        - C++ methods which act like properties are represented as properties,
          e.g. GenParticle::set_status and GenParticle::status are mapped to a single
          GenParticle.status field in Python
        - Tuples and lists are implicitly convertible to FourVectors
        - ReaderAscii and WriterAscii support the context manager protocol
        
        License: pyhepmc-ng is covered by the BSD license, but the license only
        applies to the binding code. The HepMC3 code is covered by the GPL-v3 license.
