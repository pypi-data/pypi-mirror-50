Description: net-genconfig
        =============
        
        This package generates configurations for network devices based on two sources
        of information:
        
        * templates -- these Jinja2 files form the basis of a configuration file and
          exist for each different device role (core router, edge switch, etc.)
        
        * inventory -- this is a big database of device details (including the role for
          a particular device) and associated information, such as VLANs, subnets,
          interfaces, etc.
