This package implements Jeongwan Haah's algorithm for quantum signal processing as described in this 
[paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.10236). It includes a step by step 
algorithm that decomposes periodic functions (often from quantum signal processing) into a product of primitive matrices,
represented as a list of angles. The algorithmic complexity is O(N<sup>3</sup> polylog(N/ùú∫)) where N is the degree of the
periodic function and ùú∫ is the precision parameter. The runtime bottleneck is a polynomial rootfinding in step 2. Haah 
concludes that the error is at most the error input (=15ùú∫).
DISCLAIMER: This is in initial investigation stages, and the usage is subject to change.
