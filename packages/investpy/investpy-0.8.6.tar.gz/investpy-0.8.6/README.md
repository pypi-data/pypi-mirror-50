## Introduction

Since [**Investing**](https://es.investing.com/) does not have an API, I decided to develop this Python scraper in order to retrieve historical data from the companies that integrate the **Continuous Spanish Stock Market**. The scraper is a Python package everyone can use through PyPi (Python Package Installer) via [investpy](https://pypi.org/project/investpy/).

The main purpose of developing this package was to use it as the **Data Extraction** tool for its namesake section, for my Final Degree Project at the University of Salamanca titled "**Machine Learning for stock investment recommendation systems**". The package end up being so consistent, reliable and usable that it is going to be used as the main Data Extraction tool by another students in their Final Degree Projects named "*Recommender system of banking products*" and "*Robo-Advisor Application*".

To conclude this section, I am in the need to specify that this is not the final version of the package, this is just a beta version of it that will keep going while I develop a consistent Python package for financial data extraction.

## Installation

In order to get this package working you will need to install [**investpy**](https://pypi.org/project/investpy/) from PyPi via Terminal typing:

``pip install investpy==0.8.6``

All the dependencies are already listed on the setup file of the package, but to sum them up, you will need the following requirements:

* [**pandas 0.24.2**](https://pypi.org/project/pandas/)
* [**requests 2.22.0**](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)
* [**lxml 4.3.3**](https://pypi.org/project/lxml/)
* [**unidecode 1.0.23**](https://pypi.org/project/unidecode/)

## Disclaimer

This Python Package has been made for research purposes in order to fit a needs that Investing.com does not cover, so this package works like an Application Programming Interface (API) of Investing.com developed in an altruistic way. Conclude that this package is not related in any way with Investing.com or any dependant company, the only requirement for developing this package was to mention the source where data is retrieved.
