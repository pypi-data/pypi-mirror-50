# In this pipeline, we'll perform a basic analysis which fits a single serial trap species to a set of charge
# injection imaging data. This will include a hyper-phase which scales the noise in the analysis, to prevent
# over-fitting the highest S/N charge injection images. The pipeline uses three phases:

# Phase 1) Fit a small section (the top 10 rows of every charge injection) using a serial CTI model
#          with 1 trap species and a model for the serial CCD volume filling parameters.

# Phase 2) Use the best-fit model from phase 1 to scale the noise of each image, to ensure that the higher and
#          lower S/N images are weighted more equally in their contribution to the likelihood.

# Phase 3) Refit the phase 1 model, using priors initialized from the results of phase 1 and the scaled noise-map
#          computed in phase 2.

    # 1) Use the complete charge injection image, as opposed to extracting a sub-set of rows.
    # 3) Initialize the priors on the serial CTI model from the results of phase 1 of the initialize pipeline.
