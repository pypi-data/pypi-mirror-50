class FieldSampler:
    """Field Sampler Class

    This class keeps track of all the methods for interfacing between Field
    calculation methods and the user.

    All source classes will inherit this, so non-implemented methods for some
    objects that are here should throw a warning if called.

    Returns

        """
        This method can be used to determine the field for a given set
        of sample positions, or for different magnet positions and orientations.
        While this can manually be achieved by looping getB, this getBsweep
        implements the possibility of parallelization. 

        The input can have two different formats (ONLY THE FIRST ONE CAN BE
        USED FOR COLLECTIONS!):

        Warning
        -------
           Multiprocessing enabled calculations will drastically reduce performance if done for small sets, i.e. under a few hundred.

        Parameters
        ----------
        INPUT : TYPE [type 1 or type 2 input] 
           INPUT TYPE 1 is a list of N sample positions. In this case the magnetic field of the source is determined for all N sample positions and returned in an Nx3 array. INPUT TYPE 2 is a list of the following format [(samplePos1, sourcePos1, sourceOrient1),â€¦]. Here for each case of sample position and source state the field is evaluated and returned in an Nx3 array. This corresponds to a system where sample and magnet move simultaneously. TYPE 2 DOES NOT WORK FOR COLLECTIONS !

        multiprocessing : bool [bool] Default = False
           Enable/disable parallel multiprocessing; This requires some additional code on Windows, please refer to example below.

        processes : cores [int]
           Define the number of allowed processes when multiprocessing is enabled.

        Example
        -------
        For INPUT of type 1:

        >>> from multiprocessing import freeze_support
        >>> if __name__ == "__main__":
        >>>     freeze_support()
        >>>     # Input
        >>>     from magpylib.source import magnet
        >>>     mag=[6,7,8]
        >>>     dim=[10,10,10]
        >>>     pos=[2,2,2]
        >>>     listOfPos = [[.5,.5,5],[.5,.5,5],[.5,.5,5]]
        >>>     # Run
        >>>     pm = magnet.Box(mag,dim,pos)
        >>>     result = pm.getBsweep(listOfPos)
        >>>     print(result)
