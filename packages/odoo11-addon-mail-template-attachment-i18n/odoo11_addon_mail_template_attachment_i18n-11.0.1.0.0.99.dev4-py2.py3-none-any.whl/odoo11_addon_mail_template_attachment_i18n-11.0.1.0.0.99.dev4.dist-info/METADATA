This module extends the functionality of mail templates.
It allows you to configure attachments based on the language of the partner.
For example you can use it to localize your company's terms of agreements.

Configuration
=============

To configure a language dependent attachment:

#. Activate the developer mode;
#. go to *Settings > Technical > Email > Templates*;
#. go to the form view of the template you want to change;
#. change the field *Language Dependent Attachments* to what you want.

Usage
=====

When a template is selected in the mail composer, the attachments will be automatically added based on the recipients language.
The language of the recipients can be configured on the Partner form view.
When partners with different languages are selected all attachments of the partners languages will be added.

To use the functionality:

#. Configure a template (e.g. the sale order mail template)
#. go to a sale order;
#. click *Send by Email*;
#. the attachments are added based on the customer's language.
