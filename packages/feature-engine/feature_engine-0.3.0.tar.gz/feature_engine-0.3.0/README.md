# Feature Engine

Feature Engine is a python library that contains several transformers to engineer features for use in machine learning models.
The transformers follow scikit-learn like functionality. They first learn the imputing or encoding methods from the training set, and subsequently transform the dataset.
Currently the transformers include functionality for:

* Missing value imputation
* Categorical variable encoding
* Outlier removal
* Discretisation
* Numerical Variable Transformation

### Installing

```
pip install feature_engine
```
or

```
git clone https://github.com/solegalli/feature_engine.git
```

### Usage

```
from feature_engine.categorical_encoders import RareLabelEncoder

rare_encoder = RareLabelEncoder(tol = 0.05, n_categories=5)
rare_encoder.fit(data, variables = ['Cabin', 'Age'])
data_encoded = rare_encoder.transform(data)
```

See more usage examples in the jupyter notebooks in the example section
