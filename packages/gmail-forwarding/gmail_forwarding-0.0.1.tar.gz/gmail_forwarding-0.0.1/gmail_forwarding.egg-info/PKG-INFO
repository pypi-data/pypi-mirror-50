        Have your friends subscribe to some stream of emails and forward them automatically.
        
        ## Use case
        You have an Amazon Prime account that all your friends are using.
        They won't stop bothering you about refund/return issues.
        Now you can forward the problem to this amazing tool.
        
        ## Technology
        Using Gmail API.
        Everyone uses gmail - so I don't think it's quite a big restriction.
