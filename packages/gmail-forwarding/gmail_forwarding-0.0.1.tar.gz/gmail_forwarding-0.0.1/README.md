Have your friends subscribe to some stream of emails and forward them automatically.

## Use case
You have an Amazon Prime account that all your friends are using.
They won't stop bothering you about refund/return issues.
Now you can forward the problem to this amazing tool.

## Technology
Using Gmail API.
Everyone uses gmail - so I don't think it's quite a big restriction.

## Contribution
