class QUBOMatrix(dict):
    """QUBOMatrix.

    A class to handle QUBO matrices. It is the same thing as a dictionary
    with some methods modified. Note that each key must be a tuple of two
    integers >= 0.

    One method is that values will always default to 0. Consider the following
    example:

    >>> d = QUBOMatrix()
    >>> print(d[(0, 0)]) # will print 0
    >>> d[(0, 0)] += 1
    >>> print(d) # will print {(0, 0): 1}

    Compared to an ordinary dictionary.

    >>> g = dict()
    >>> print(g[(0, 0)]) # will raise KeyError
    >>> g[(0, 0)] += 1 # will raise KeyError, since (0, 0) was never set

    One method of QUBOMatrix is that it will always keep the QUBO
    upper triangular! Consider the following example:

    >>> d = QUBOMatrix()
    >>> d[(1, 0)] += 2
    >>> print(d)
    >>> # will print {(0, 1): 2}

    One method is that if we set an item to 0, it will be removed. Consider
    the following example:

    >>> d = QUBOMatrix()
    >>> d[(0, 0)] += 1
    >>> d[(0, 0)] -= 1
    >>> print(d) # will print {}

    One method is that if we initialize QUBOMatrix with a previous dictionary
    it will be reinitialized to ensure that the QUBOMatrix is upper
    triangular and contains no zero values. Consider the following example:

    >>> d = QUBOMatrix({(0, 0): 1, (1, 0): 2, (2, 0): 0})
    >>> print(d) # will print {(0, 0): 1, (0, 1): 2}

    We also change the update method so that it follows all the conventions.

    >>> d = QUBOMatrix({(0, 0): 1, (0, 1): 2})
    >>> d.update({(0, 0): 0, (1, 0): 1, (1, 1): -1})
    >>> print(d)  # will print {(0, 1): 1, (1, 1): -1}

    We also include arithmetic, addition, subtraction, scalar division,
    scalar multiplication, and all those in place. For example,

    >>> d = QUBOMatrix((0, 0)=1, (0, 1)=-2)
    >>> g = d + {(0, 0): -1}
    >>> print(g) # will print {(0, 1): -2}
    >>> g *= 4
    >>> print(g) # will print {(0, 1): -8}
    >>> g -= {(0, 1): -8}
    >>> print(g) # will print {}

    Finally, if you try to access a key out of order, it will sort the key. Be
    careful with this, it can cause unexpected behavior if you don't know it.
    For example,

    >>> d = QUBOMatrix()
    >>> d[(0, 1)] += 2
    >>> print(d[(1, 0)])  # will print 2

class IsingCoupling(QUBOMatrix):
    """IsingCoupling.

    A class to handle the J coupling Ising matrices, inherits from QUBOMatrix.
    It is the same thing as a dictionary with some methods modified. Note that
    each key must be a tuple of two integers >= 0. Note that this is almost
    exactly the same as QUBOMatrix, except that the keys cannot be tuples of
    the same index. For example, ``QUBOMatrix({(0, 0): 1})`` is valid but
    ``IsingCoupling({(0, 0): 1})`` is invalid.

    One method is that values will always default to 0. Consider the following
    example:

    >>> d = IsingCoupling()
    >>> print(d[(0, 1)]) # will print 0
    >>> d[(0, 1)] += 1
    >>> print(d) # will print {(0, 1): 1}

    Compared to an ordinary dictionary.

    >>> g = dict()
    >>> print(g[(0, 1)]) # will raise KeyError
    >>> g[(0, 1)] += 1 # will raise KeyError, since (0, 0) was never set

    One method of IsingCoupling is that it will always keep the coupling
    upper triangular! Consider the following example:

    >>> d = IsingCoupling()
    >>> d[(1, 0)] += 2
    >>> print(d)
    {(0, 1): 2}

    One method is that if we set an item to 0, it will be removed. Consider
    the following example:

    >>> d = IsingCoupling()
    >>> d[(0, 1)] += 1
    >>> d[(0, 1)] -= 1
    >>> print(d) # will print {}

    One method is that if we initialize IsingCoupling with a previous
    dictionary, it will be reinitialized to ensure that the IsingCoupling is
    upper triangular and contains no zero values. Consider the following
    example:

    >>> d = IsingCoupling({(0, 1): 1, (1, 0): 2, (2, 0): 0})
    >>> print(d) # will print {(0, 1): 3}

    We also change the update method so that it follows all the conventions
    .
    >>> d = IsingCoupling({(0, 1): 1, (0, 2): 2})
    >>> d.update({(1, 0): 0, (2, 1): 1})
    >>> print(d)  # will print {(1, 2): 1, (0, 2): 2}

    We also include arithmetic, addition, subtraction, scalar division,
    scalar multiplication, and all those in place. For example,

    >>> d = IsingCoupling((0, 2)=1, (0, 1)=-2)
    >>> g = d + {(0, 2): -1}
    >>> print(g) # will print {(0, 1): -2}
    >>> g *= 4
    >>> print(g) # will print {(0, 1): -8}
    >>> g -= {(0, 1): -8}
    >>> print(g) # will print {}

    Finally, if you try to access a key out of order, it will sort the key. Be
    careful with this, it can unexpected behavior if you don't know it.
    For example,

    >>> d = IsingCoupling()
    >>> d[(0, 1)] += 2
    >>> print(d[(1, 0)])  # will print 2

        Parameters
        ----------
        key : tuple of two different integers.
            Element of the dictionary.
        value : numeric.
            Value corresponding to the key.

                "Key formatted incorrectly, "

class IsingField(QUBOMatrix):
    """IsingField.

    A class to handle the h field Ising matrices, inherits from QUBOMatrix.
    It is the same thing as a dictionary with some methods modified. Note that
    each key must be an an integer >= 0. Note that this is almost exactly the
    same as QUBOMatrix, except that the keys are integers instead of tuples.

    One method is that values will always default to 0. Consider the following
    example:

    >>> d = IsingField()
    >>> print(d[0]) # will print 0
    >>> d[0] += 1
    >>> print(d) # will print {0: 1}

    Compared to an ordinary dict.

    >>> g = dict()
    >>> print(g[0]) # will raise KeyError
    >>> g[0] += 1 # will raise KeyError, since (0, 0) was never set

    One method is that if we set an item to 0, it will be removed. Consider
    the following example:

    >>> d = IsingField()
    >>> d[1] += 1
    >>> d[1] -= 1
    >>> print(d) # will print {}

    One method is that if we initialize IsingField with a previous
    dictionary, it will be reinitialized to ensure that the IsingField is
    contains no zero values and is all valid. Consider the following
    example:

    >>> d = IsingField({0: 1, 1: 2, 2: 0})
    >>> print(d) # will print {0: 1, 1: 2}

    We also change the update method so that it follows all the conventions.

    >>> d = IsingField({0: 1, 2: -2})
    >>> d.update({0: 0, 1: 1})
    >>> print(d)  # will print {1: 1, 2: -2}

    We also include arithmetic, addition, subtraction, scalar division,
    scalar multiplication, and all those in place. For example,

    >>> d = IsingField(0=1, 1=-2)
    >>> g = d + {0: -1}
    >>> print(g) # will print {1: -2}
    >>> g *= 4
    >>> print(g) # will print {1: -8}
    >>> g -= {1: -8}
    >>> print(g) # will print {}

        Overrides the dict.__setitem__ command. If `value` is equal to 0, then
        the key will be removed from the dictionary. Thus no elements in the
        IsingCoupling dictionary will ever have zero value. Additionally, this
        method will keep the coupling upper triangular, so if key[0] > key[1],
