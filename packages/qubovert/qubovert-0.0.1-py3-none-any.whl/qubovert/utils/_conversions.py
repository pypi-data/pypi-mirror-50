from . import QUBOMatrix, IsingCoupling, IsingField


def qubo_to_ising(Q, offset=0):
    """qubo_to_ising.

    Convert the specified QUBO problem into an Ising problem. Note that
    QUBO {0, 1} values go to Ising {-1, 1} values in that order!

    Parameters
    ----------
    Q : dictionary or qubovert.utils.QUBOMatrix object.
        Maps tuples of binary variables indices to the Q value.
    offset : float (optional, defaults to 0).
             The part of the objective function that does not depend on the
             variables.

    Returns
    ------
    result : tuple (h, J, offset).
        h : qubovert.utils.IsingField object.
            The field of each spin in the Ising formulation.
            h is a IsingField object. For most practical purposes, you can
            use IsingField in he same way as an ordinary dictionary. For
            more information, see ``help(qubovert.utils.IsingField)``.
        J : qubovert.utils.IsingCoupling object.
            The upper triangular coupling matrix, an IsingCoupling object.
            For most practical purposes, you can use IsingCoupling in the
            same way as an ordinary dictionary. For more information,
            see ``help(qubovert.utils.IsingCoupling)``.
        offset : float.
            It is the sum of the terms in the formulation in
            the cited paper that don't involve any variables.

    Example
    -------
    >>> Q = {(0, 0): 1, (0, 1): -1, (1, 1): 3}
    >>> h, J, offset = qubo_to_ising(Q)

    """
    # IsingCoupling deals with keeping J upper triangular, so we don't have to
    # worry about it!
    h, J = IsingField(), IsingCoupling()

    for (i, j), v in Q.items():
        if i != j:
            J[(i, j)] += v / 4
            h[i] += v / 4
            h[j] += v / 4
            offset += v / 4
        else:
            h[i] += v / 2
            offset += v / 2

    return h, J, offset


def ising_to_qubo(h, J, offset=0):
    """ising_to_qubo.

    Convert the specified Ising problem into an upper triangular QUBO problem.
    Note that Ising {-1, 1} values go to QUBO {0, 1} values in that order!

    Parameters
    ----------
    h : dictionary or qubovert.utils.IsingField object.
        Maps spin indices to the field value.
    J : dictionary or qubovert.utils.IsingCoupling object.
        Maps tuples of spin indices to the coupling value. Note
        that J cannot have a key that has a repeated index, ie (1, 1) is an
        invalid key.
    offset : float (optional, defaults to 0).
        The part of the objective function that does not depend on the
        variables.

    Returns
    -------
    result : tuple (Q, offset).
        Q : qubovert.utils.QUBOMatrix object.
            The upper triangular QUBO matrix, a QUBOMatrix object.
            For most practical purposes, you can use QUBOMatrix in the
            same way as an ordinary dictionary. For more information,
            see ``help(qubovert.utils.QUBOMatrix)``.
        offset : float.
            The sum of the terms in the formulation that don't involve any
            variables.

    Example
    -------
    >>> h = {0: 1, 1: -1}
    >>> J = {(0, 1): -1}
    >>> Q, offset = ising_to_qubo(h, J)
