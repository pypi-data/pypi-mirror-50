Convert common problems to QUBO form.
-------------------------------------

So far we have just implemented some of the formulations from [Lucas]_. The goal of QUBOVert is to become a large collection of problems mapped to QUBO and Ising forms in order to aid the recent increase in study of these problems due to quantum optimization algorithms. I am hoping to have a lot of participation so that we can compile all these problems!

To participate, fork the repository, add your contributions, and submit a pull request. Add tests for any functionality that you add. Make sure you run ``python -m pytest``, ``python -m pytest --codestyle --ignore=docs`` before committing anything (yes, even the `tests` need to pass codestyle checks), and ``python -m pydocstyle convention=numpy qubovert`` to ensure that the build passes. When you push changes to the master branch, Travis-CI will automatically check to see if all the tests pass. Note that all problems should be derived from the ``qubovert.utils.Problem`` class! Make sure all your docstrings follow the Numpydoc standard format.


Use Python's ``help`` function! I have very descriptive doc strings on all the functions and classes.

Installation
------------
.. code:: shell

  pip install qubovert


To install from source:

.. code:: shell

  git clone https://github.com/jiosue/qubovert.git
  cd QUBOVert
  pip install -e .


Then you can use it in Python with

.. code:: python

    import qubovert

    # get info
    help(qubovert)

    # see all the problems specified
    print(qubovert.__all__)
    # or equivalently
    print(qubovert.problems.__all__)

    # see the utilities defined
    help(qubovert.utils)
    print(qubovert.utils.__all__)

    # to see specifically the np problems:
    help(qubovert.problems.np)
    print(qubovert.problems.np.__all__)

    # to see specifically the benchmarking problems:
    help(qubovert.problems.benchmarking)
    print(qubovert.problems.benchmarking.__all__)

    # etc ...


See the following Set Cover example. All other problems can be used in a similar way.

.. code:: python

    from qubovert import SetCover
    from any_module import qubo_solver
    # or you can use my bruteforce solver...
    # from qubovert.utils import solve_qubo_bruteforce as qubo_solver

    U = {"a", "b", "c", "d"}
    V = [{"a", "b"}, {"a", "c"}, {"c", "d"}]

    problem = SetCover(U, V)
    Q, offset = problem.to_qubo()

    obj, sol = qubo_solver(Q)
    obj += offset

    solution = problem.convert_solution(sol)

    print(solution) # will print {0, 2}
    print(problem.is_solution_valid(solution)) # will print True, since V[0] + V[2] covers all of U
    print(obj == len(solution)) # will print True

To use the Ising formulation instead:

.. code:: python

    from qubovert import SetCover
    from any_module import ising_solver
    # or you can use my bruteforce solver...
    # from qubovert.utils import solve_ising_bruteforce as ising_solver

    U = {"a", "b", "c", "d"}
    V = [{"a", "b"}, {"a", "c"}, {"c", "d"}]

    problem = SetCover(U, V)
    h, J, offset = problem.to_ising()

    obj, sol = ising_solver(h, J)
    obj += offset

    solution = problem.convert_solution(sol)

    print(solution) # will print {0, 2}
    print(problem.is_solution_valid(solution)) # will print True, since V[0] + V[2] covers all of U
    print(obj == len(solution)) # will print True


To see problem specifics, run

.. code:: python

    help(qubovert.SetCover)
    help(qubovert.VertexCover)
    # etc

I have very descriptive doc strings that should explain everything you need to know to use each problem class.


Technical details on the conversions
------------------------------------
For the log trick he mentions, we usually need a constraint like ``sum(x) >= 1``. In order to enforce this constraint, we add a penalty to the QUBO of the form ``1 - sum(x) + sum(x[i] x[j] for i in range(len(x)) for j in range(i+1, len(x)))`` (the idea comes from [Glover]_).
