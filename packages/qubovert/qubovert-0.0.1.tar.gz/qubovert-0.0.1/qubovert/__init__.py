"""``qubovert`` is a module for converting problems into QUBO/Ising form.

QUBO stands for Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization. QUBO problems
have a one-to-one mapping to classical Ising problems, and most optimization
problems are formatted in QUBO form when the solver is a quantum computer.
See ``qubovert.__all__`` for all the problems defined, and
``qubovert.utils.__all__`` for some utilities used.
