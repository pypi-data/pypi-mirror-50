    This acts a parent class to all the QUBO and Ising conversion problem
    classes. The ``__new__`` method keeps track of the problem args. The
    ``repr`` method uses those input args, such that
    ``eval(repr(cls)) == cls``. Finally, we define a ``__eq__`` method to
    determine if two problems are the same. The rest of the methods are to be
    implemented in child classes.

    Additionally, his class defines the ``to_qubo`` and ``to_ising`` methods.
    ``to_qubo`` calls ``to_ising`` and then converts from ising to qubo.
    ``to_ising`` calls ``to_qubo`` and then converts from qubo to ising. Thus,
    the child classes MUST define either ``to_qubo`` or ``to_ising``. In this
    way, by only defining one of those, both are implemented.

        Creates the object and keeps track of the input arguments and keyword

        called before every __init__ is called. We use __new__ to keep track
        of input arguments instead of using __init__ so that child class
        implementations don't have to worry about it. Ie child classes
        don't have to call `super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)` in their
        __init__ method.
