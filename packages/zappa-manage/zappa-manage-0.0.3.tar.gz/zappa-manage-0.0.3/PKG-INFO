        ### To Do
        - [x] Repo Name
          - `zappa_manage`
        - [x] Figure out how to publish to `edX.org` repo
          - Change url in `setup.py`
        - [x] Ask Cory about ...
          - `zappa_manage/tests/` : Is it necessary? If so, here's the [guide](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing.html). Otherwise, delete the directory.
            - No need for tests at the moment.
          - `bin/` : Does this have CLI usage? If so, here's the [guide](https://python-packaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command-line-scripts.html). Otherwise, delete the repository.
            - It does have cli usage since it's used when deploying lambdas envs in GoCD.
