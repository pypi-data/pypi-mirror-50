        ==================================
        
        This git repository contains project code for the land surface recharge models (lsrm) developed at Environment Canterbury (ECan).
        The current lsrm available was originally developed by David Scott in 2013 in Fortran, but has been transcribed and improved by Mike Kittridge into this Python package.
        
        ds module
        ----------
        The ds module contains the LSRM class for running the transcribed David Scott lsrm.
        
        Initialisation does not require any parameters:
        
        .. code::
        
          l1 = LSRM()
        
        Then follow the sequence of methods: soils_import, input_processing, and lsrm.
        
        .. code::
        
          irr1, psw1 = l1.soils_import()
        
          mv, sites = self.input_processing(bound_shp, grid_res, buffer_dis, interp_fun, agg_ts_fun, time_agg)
        
          results1 = self.lsrm()
