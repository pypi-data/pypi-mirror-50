Introduction
========================================

Features
----------------------------------------

|prog|_ accepts as input(s) capture file(s) (\*.pcap) and depending on from there can :

* list the MPTCP connections in the pcap
* display some statistics on a specific MPTCP connection (list of subflows etc...);
* convert packet capture files (\*.pcap) to \*.csv files
* plot data sequence numbers for all subflows
* `XDG compliance <http://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html>`_, i.e., 
  |prog| looks for files in certain directories. will try to load your configuration from `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mptcpanalyzer/config`
* caching mechanism: mptcpanalyzer compares your pcap creation time and will
  regenerate the cache if it exists in `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/mptcpanalyzer/<path_to_the_file>`
* support 3rd party plugins (plots or commands)

Most commands are self documented and/or with autocompletion.

Then you have an interpreter with autocompletion that can generate & display plots such as the following:

How to install ?
----------------------------------------

First of all you will need a wireshark version that supports MPTCP dissection,
i.e., wireshark > 2.1.0. 
If you are on ubuntu, there are development builds available on
https://launchpad.net/~dreibh/+archive/ubuntu/ppa/.

Once wireshark is installed you can install mptcpanalyzer via pip:

.. code-block:: console
    
    $ python3.5 -mpip install mptcpanalyzer 

.. note: You can add the --user flag to install in ~/.local/bin.

python3.5+ is mandatory since we rely on its type hinting features.
Dependancies are:

- `stevedore <http://docs.openstack.org/developer/stevedore/>`_ to handle the
  plugins architecture
- the data analysis library `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ >= 0.17.1
- `matplotlib <http://matplotlib>`_ to plot graphs
- lnumexpr to run readable queries in pandas

How does it work (internals) ?
----------------------------------------

mptcpanalyzer consists of small python scripts. the heavy task is done by wireshark.
It relies on tshark (terminal version of wireshark) to convert pcap to csv files.

It accepts as input a pcap (or csv file following a proper format). 
Upon pcap detection, mptcpanalyzer the formats supported by tshark (terminal version of wireshark).
