Description: # comic2pdf
        A script to convert comic files (cbr, cbz) to pdf, in python3.
        
        ## Getting Started
        
        ### Installing
        
        Install the package using [setuptools](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools).
        
        ```
        $ python setup.py install
        ```
        
        ### Running
        
        The `comic2pdf` command should be globally available, pass as arguments the path(s) to the cbr / cbz files and optionally specify an output folder. The output files will be named the same as the input files but with a .pdf extension.
        
        ```
        usage: comic2pdf [-h] [-o OUTDIR] [--version] path [path ...]
        
        Converts .cbr and .cbz files to .pdf
        
        positional arguments:
          path                  paths to process
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -o OUTDIR, --outdir OUTDIR
                                directory to place generated files
          --version             show program's version number and exit
        ```
        
        e.g. to process all files in a folder (will ignore any file extensions except .cbr, .cbz, .rar or .zip).
        
        ```
        $ comic2pdf *
        ```
        
        ### Prerequisites
        
        Requires Python 3.6+.
        
        Production dependencies are listed in `setup.py`. Development dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.
        
        ### No install
        
        You can use the package without installing it, simply install dependencies and run the `comic2pdf.py` script. E.g.
        
        ```
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        $ python comic2pdf.py -o /dest/folder file.cbr
        ```
        
        ## Development
        
        ### Installing 
        
        Development is aided by a Makefile which uses a virtual environment. To setup the virtual environment and install dependencies:
        
        ```
        $ make init
        ```
        
        ### Running
        
        To test changes to your script, you can install a development version which links to your source code:
        
        ```
        $ python setup.py develop
        ```
        
        And this can be uninstalled with 
        
        ```
        $ python setup.py develop --uninstall
        ```
        
        You may also run the script directly, but note that the dependencies are installed into the virtual environment. To enter the virtual environment:
        
        ```
        # Windows
        $ source .venv/Scripts/activate
        # Mac
        $ source .venv/bin/activate
        ```
        
        Then run the script directly.
        
        ```
        (.venv) $ python comic2pdf.py -h
        ```
        
        ### Linting & formatting
        
        This project makes use of the [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) python code formatter which automatically reformats code. To run Black and lint the code, use:
        
        ```
        $ make lint
        ```
        
        ### Publishing
        
        1. Update `setup.py` with the new version number (e.g. 1.1.1)
        2. Create a new GitHub release (e.g. `git tag -a v1.1.1 -m "Version v1.1.1" && git push --tags`)
        3. Push to PyPI
        ```
        $ make deploy
        ```
