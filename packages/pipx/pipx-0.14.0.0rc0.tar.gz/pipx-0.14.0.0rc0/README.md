## Overview: What is `pipx`?

pipx is a tool to help you install and run end-user applications written in Python. pipx **is not** a tool for development or publishing of your code. It's kind of like macOS's `brew` (if you are familiar with that), but for Python applications.

Python and PyPI allow developers to distribute code with "console script entry points". These scripts let users call into Python code from the command line, effectively acting like standalone applications.

`pipx` is a tool to install and run any of the thousands of Python applications available on PyPI in a safe, convenient, and reliable way. **In a way, it turns Python Package Index (PyPI) into a big app store for Python applications.** Not all Python packages have entry points, but many do.

`pipx` enables you to:

- Safely install packages to isolated environments, while globally exposing their CLI entry points so you can run them from anywhere (see the `install` command). This guarantees no dependency conflicts and clean uninstalls!
- Easily list, upgrade, and uninstall packages that were installed with pipx
- Run the latest version of a Python application in a temporary environment (see the `run` command)

Best of all, pipx runs with regular user permissions, never calling `sudo pip install` (you aren't doing that, are you? ðŸ˜„).

pipx is similar to JavaScript's [npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) - which ships with npm, but also allows you to install instead of just run. pipx does not ship with pip but installing it is often an important part of bootstrapping your system.

### Safely installing to isolated environments

You can globally install an application by running

```
pipx install PACKAGE
```

This automatically creates a virtual environment, installs the package, and adds the package's associated applications (entry points) to a location on your `PATH`. For example, `pipx install pycowsay` makes the `pycowsay` command available globally, but sandboxes the pycowsay package in its own virtual environment. **pipx never needs to run as sudo to do this.**

Example:

```
>> pipx install pycowsay
  installed package pycowsay 2.0.3, Python 3.7.3
  These apps are now globally available
    - pycowsay
done! âœ¨ ðŸŒŸ âœ¨


>> pipx list
venvs are in /home/user/.local/pipx/venvs
apps are exposed on your $PATH at /home/user/.local/bin
   package pycowsay 2.0.3, Python 3.7.3
    - pycowsay


>> pycowsay mooo
  ____
< mooo >
  ====
         \
          \
            ^__^
            (oo)\_______
            (__)\       )\/\
                ||----w |
                ||     ||


```

### Running in temporary, sandboxed environments

pipx makes running the latest version of a program in a temporary environment as easy as

```
pipx run APP [ARGS...]
```

This will install the package in an isolated, temporary directory and invoke the app. Try it!

```
pipx run pycowsay moo
```

Notice that you **don't need to execute any install commands to run the app**.

Re-running the same app is quick because pipx caches Virtual Environments on a per-app basis. These caches last two days.

I find this handy when I want to quickly see the help text of an application, or when I occasionally run an app but don't necessarily want it hanging around on my system. A nice side benefit is that you don't have to remember to upgrade it since `pipx run` will automatically run a recent version for you.

You can run .py files directly, too.

```
pipx run https://gist.githubusercontent.com/cs01/fa721a17a326e551ede048c5088f9e0f/raw/6bdfbb6e9c1132b1c38fdd2f195d4a24c540c324/pipx-demo.py
pipx is working!
```
