Description: [`squircle.py`](https://pypi.org/project/squircle/) is a Python utility for
        stretching circles into squares and squishing squares into circles. It requires
        Python 3.6 or later.
        
        ### Installation
        
        ```sh
        pip insall squircle
        ```
        
        ### Usage:
        
        ```python
        from squircle import to_circle, to_square
        from PIL import Image
        
        square = np.asarray(Image.open('some-square-image.jpg'))
        circle = to_circle(square)
        and_back_to_square = to_square(circle)
        ```
        
        there's 3 stretching methods you can choose from
        
        ```python
        >>> from squircle import methods
        >>> list(methods.keys())
        ['fgs', 'stretch', 'elliptical']
        >>> circle = to_circle(square, method='elliptical')
        ```
        
        #### Stretching methods
        
        ##### Fernández-Guasti squircle (`fgs`)
        
        The Fernández-Guasti squircle is used by default.

        ##### Simple Stretching (`stretch`)
        
        This method just linearly stretches each point radially so that the rim of the circle matches the rim of the square.

        ##### Elliptical grid mapping (`elliptical`)
        
        "The way I went about this was to think of a line of constant x (as well as a line of constant y) getting mapped to an ellipse in the circle"

        ##### Schwarz-Christoffel conformal mapping
        
        `raise NotImplementedError`. The math is difficult.

        This code is converted from the C++ sources on Chamberlain Fong's blog posts, which (I think) is based on his paper [Analytical Methods for Squaring the Disc by C Fong 2014](https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1509/1509.06344.pdf).
        
        Squircle doesn't handle ellipses/rectangles, this more recent paper should be useful: [Elliptification of Rectangular Imagery by C Fong - ‎2017](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.07875.pdf)
        
        
        ### Development
        
        After `pip install tox` you can run squircle's (limited) test set with
        
        ```sh
        tox
        ```
        
        On Ubuntu, you also need the following dependencies for numpy and matplotlib
        
        ```sh
        sudo apt install python3-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libfreetype6-dev
        ```
