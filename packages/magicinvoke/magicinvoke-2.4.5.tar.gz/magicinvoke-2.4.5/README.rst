Welcome to MagicInvoke!
=========================

Magicinvoke is a Python (2.7 and 3.4+) library based on
`Invoke <http://pyinvoke.org>`_.

It adds ``get_params_from_ctx``, ``skippable``, and ``magictask``,
as well as including a patched version of ``invoke`` with 
support for ``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` on tasks,
some clearer exceptions, and some minor bugfixes.

For docs and to see what magicinvoke has to offer you,
`see here <https://magicinvoke.readthedocs.io>`_.

Report issues and help out `here <https://github.com/haydenflinner/magicinvoke>`_.

For getting started , we recommend you start with ``invoke``
and then start mixing in ``magicinvoke`` once you feel the need
for a bit more power. See the
`examples <https://magicinvoke.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#jump-in>`_
page of the ``magicinvoke`` doc.
