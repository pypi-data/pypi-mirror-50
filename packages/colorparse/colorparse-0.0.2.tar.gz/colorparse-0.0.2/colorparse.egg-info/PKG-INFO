Description: # Colorparse
        
        This unoriginal package let's the user generate strings with ansi color escape sequences (which are "*codes*" that tell the terminal what color to display the proceeding characters, and much more: <https://wikipedia.org/wiki/ANSI_escape_code>)
        
        Colorparse will simplify the work by reading it's self-defined "*color codes*" inside the strings (e.g. `;r` will produce the color red). For this module's  documentation, go to <https://github.com/tubi-carrillo/colorparse>.
        
        Beware that the words "color code(s)" will be used extensively.
