Welcome to PyU4V
================

NOTE

A library showing some of the functionality possible using the RestAPI of Dell EMC's Unisphere for VMAX.
See the documentation here: http://pyu4v.readthedocs.io/.
Get the Unisphere for VMAX Rest documentation by navigating to https://<ip-address>:<port-number>/univmax/restapi/docs,
where <ip-address> = the ip of your Unisphere server and <port-number> = the corresponding port to connect through,
eg: https://10.0.0.1:8443/univmax/restapi/docs.

VERSION 3

Please note that version '3.0.0.16' of the library is NOT BACKWARDS
COMPATIBLE with existing scripts, and does not support any
Unisphere for VMAX version earlier than 8.4 - PyU4V version 2.0.2.6 is still
available on Pip, and there is a 'stable/2.0' branch available on Github.
Version 3 will be the version maintained going forward, and we do suggest
you move to this version when it is released.

WHAT'S SUPPORTED

This package supports Unisphere version 8.4 onwards. We support VMAX3 and
VMAX All-Flash and PowerMAX.

INSTALLATION

To give the master branch a try, clone the package using git (see the link above), and install the package using pip
(switch to the newly cloned PyU4V directory and run 'pip install .'). Copy the sample PyU4V.conf into your working
directory, and add your server and array details to the top of the PyU4V.conf configuration file, under the [setup]
heading. Alternatively, you can pass some or all of these details on initialisation.
Password, username, server_ip, port, and array MUST be set (either in the config file or on initialisation).
Verify can be left as is, or you can enable SSL verification by following the directions below
(see SSL CONFIGURATION).

SSL CONFIGURATION

1. Get the CA certificate of the Unisphere server.

    # openssl s_client -showcerts -connect {server_hostname}:8443 </dev/null 2>/dev/null|openssl x509 -outform PEM > {server_hostname}.pem

    (This pulls the CA cert file and saves it as server_hostname.pem e.g. esxi01vm01.pem)
2.	Either (a) add the certificate to a ca-certificates bundle, OR (b) add the path to the conf file:
    a. - Copy the pem file to the system certificate directory:
          .. code-block:: bash

             # cp {server_hostname}.pem /usr/share/ca-certificates/{server_hostname}.crt

       - Update CA certificate database with the following commands (Ensure the new cert file is highlighted)
          .. code-block:: bash

             # dpkg-reconfigure ca-certificates
             # update-ca-certificates

       - In the conf file ensure "verify=True" OR pass the value in on initialization

    b. In the conf file insert the following:
       verify=/{path-to-file}/{server_hostname}.pem OR pass the value in on initialization.

USAGE

PyU4V could also be used as the backend for a script, or a menu etc.
Just import the PyU4V package, create the connection to the server by instantiating an instance of U4VConn, and you're
good to go. The functions are divided up into categories - common, provisioning, replication and performance.

.. code-block:: python

    import PyU4V

    conn = PyU4V.U4VConn()
    conn.provisioning.get_host_list()
    conn.replication.find_expired_snapvx_snapshots()

If you wish to query another array without changing the configuration file, call the 'set_array_id(new_array_id)'
function, e.g.

.. code-block:: python

    conn.set_array_id('000197123456')


EXAMPLES

There are a number of examples which can be run with minimal set-up. For details on how to run these,
and other very useful information, please see Paul Martin's blog https://community.emc.com/people/PaulCork/blog

FUTURE

This is still a work in progress. To be expected in the future:
 - Expansion of the RestFunctions library
 - Improved exception handling and logging
 - Unittests
 - Tutorials

CONTRIBUTION

Please do! Create a fork of the project into your own repository. Make all your necessary changes and create a pull
request with a description on what was added or removed and details explaining the changes in lines of code.
Please run the following:

.. code-block:: bash

   # tox -e py27
   # tox -e py36
   # tox -e py37
   # tox -e pep8
   # tox -e pylint

.. note::

   If you do not have all the versions of python installed, just run tox on
   the versions you have. pep8 and pylint must run clean also.

If it all looks good, I'll merge it.
