'''
To render 3d scenes (or even high dimensional), the first thing we need is 
the ability to rotate the objects we render and view them from different angles. 
This can be done with rotation matrices or quaternions. 
We favor the rotation matrix since they are simpler and can be used in spaces of arbitrary dimensionality.
Rotation matrices are simply collections of orthonormal vectors that form a basis of the space we are in.
This module provides methods to generate various kinds of rotation matrices.
