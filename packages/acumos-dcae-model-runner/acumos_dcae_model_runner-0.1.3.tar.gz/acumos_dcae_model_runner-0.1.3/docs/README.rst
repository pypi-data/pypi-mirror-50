Acumos DCAE Model Runner
========================

The Acumos DCAE model runner enables Acumos Python models to be run as if they were
DCAE components.

Each Acumos model method is mapped to a subscriber and publisher stream,
with ``_subscriber`` and ``_publisher`` suffixes respectively. For example,
a model with a ``transform`` method would have ``transform_subscriber`` and
``transform_publisher`` streams.

The model runner implements DCAE APIs such as health checks and configuration
updates.

The ``acumos_dcae_model_runner`` Python package provides a command line utility
that can be used to instantiate the model runner. See the tutorial for more information.

The ``acumos_dcae_model_runner`` package should be installed in the docker image
that is ultimately on-boarded into DCAE. The model runner CLI utility should be
the entry point of that Docker image, as shown in the Dockerfile provided
in ``example/`` directory in the root of the `Acumos DCAE Model Runner repository
<https://gerrit.acumos.org/r/gitweb?p=python-dcae-model-runner.git;a=summary>`__.

Installation
============

The ``acumos_dcae_model_runner`` package can be installed with pip like so:

.. code:: bash

    pip install acumos_dcae_model_runner

**Note**: installing ``acumos_dcae_model_runner`` will also install the latest version
of `dcaeapplib <https://pypi.org/project/dcaeapplib/>`__, which is only compatible
with DCAE Dublin or later. To use ``acumos_dcae_model_runner`` with earlier versions
of DCAE, be sure to pin or bound the version of ``dcaeapplib`` appropriately. Consult
the DCAE documentation for more information.
