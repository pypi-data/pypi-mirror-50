Ontology locators tell OnToCode where to find ontologies. OnToCode uses
Owlready2_ to load ontologies and therefore supports loading `OWL 2.0`_
ontologies in the following formats:

* NTriples
* OWL/XML
* RDF/XML

Ontologies can be loaded from the file system (see
:class:`.FileSystemOntologyLocator`) or via URL (see
:class:`.URLOntologyLocator`).

An ontology locator is created by calling the constructor of a ontology locator
class.

Ontologies are loaded by :ref:`instantiations<instantiations>` for the ontology
locators passed to their constructors. Each
:ref:`instantiation<instantiations>` loads ontologies into its own
:class:`owlready2.namespace.World` object.
