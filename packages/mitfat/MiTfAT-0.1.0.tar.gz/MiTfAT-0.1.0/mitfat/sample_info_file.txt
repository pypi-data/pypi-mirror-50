## This is a template for input files for the MiTfAT library,
#  a pyhton-based fMRI analysis tool.
# In which line you write the info is irrelevant.
# every line starting with '#', or not starting with a valid keyword is ignored.
# There should be at least one blank space between the keyword and the data.
# The only obligatory keywords are the DATA_FILE and MASK_FILE.

# valid keywords are:
# 'DATA_FILE:' -> (REQUIRED) name of the nifty data files
# 'MASK_FILE:' -> (REQUIRED) nifty file including the mask file.
                   In the mask file, 0 means ignore the voxel,
                                     non-zero means read the voxel.
# 'TIME_FILE:' -> file including time points for each data point.
                  If left blank, indices of data points are used in plots.
# 'EVENT_TIMES' -> can be any events of interest.
                    should be numbers (float or integer), comma separated.
                    They'd be irrelevant if TIME_FILE does not exist.
                    They do not need to match exact values of time steps.
# 'DIR_SOURCE:' -> Absolute path to source directory.
                   default is 'datasets' subfolder inside current folder.
# 'DIR_SAVE' -> Absolute path to directory used to save the outputs.
                default is used: 'outputs' subfolder inside current folder.
# 'MOL_NAME:' -> Molecule name. Used in molecular fMRI experiments.
                 If not left blank will be used to establish DIR_SAVE name.
# 'EXP_NAME' -> Experiment name.
                 If not left blank will be used to establish DIR_SAVE name.
# 'DESC'-> A free style text with info about the dataset.
# 'DS_NO' -> A number assigned to identify the dataset.
             If not left blank will be used to establish DIR_SAVE name.
# 'SIGNAL_NAME' -> can be T1w, FISP, T2w* or any arbitrary string.

## Here is a sample info file:
DATA_FILE: sample_data_T1w.nii.gz
MASK_FILE: sample_data_mask.nii.gz
TIME_FILE: sample_data_time_T1w.txt
MOL_NAME: SCA
SIGNAL_NAME: T1w
DS_NO: 1
EXP_NAME: Exp1
# DIR_SOURCE: ../resources/datasets/
DESC: Just a sample dataset.
EVENT_TIMES: 123,181
