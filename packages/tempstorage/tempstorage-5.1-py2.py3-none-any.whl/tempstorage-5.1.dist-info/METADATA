Overview
========

A storage implementation which uses RAM to persist objects, much like
MappingStorage. Unlike MappingStorage, it needs not be packed to get rid of
non-cyclic garbage and it does rudimentary conflict resolution. This is a
ripoff of Jim's Packless bsddb3 storage.

**Please note: Usage of this package is deprecated, as it is known to randomly lose data, especially with Zope 4.**

For a detailed discussion see `#8 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/tempstorage/issues/8>`_ as well as `#12 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/tempstorage/issues/12>`_

To replace server-side sessions, cookies are probably your best bet, as these also get rid of any denial of service problems that server side sessions are vulnerable to.

If you need server side storage of sessions, consider using a normal store rather than tempstorage for your session data.
For details and suggestions see `this discussion in the pull request <https://github.com/zopefoundation/tempstorage/pull/14#issuecomment-520318459>`_ as well as the discussion in the aforementioned bug reports as well as `the discussion in Zope about the removal of the generated configuration <https://github.com/zopefoundation/Zope/pull/684>`_.

Changelog
=========

5.1 (2019-08-15)
----------------

- Package is now officially deprecated as it was broken for many years. This 
  was/ is common knowledge in the zope community, but was not documented 
  anywhere and thus this package was still used by many community members 
  without knowing this. See
  (`#8 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/tempstorage/issues/8>`_)
  (`#12 <https://github.com/zopefoundation/tempstorage/issues/12>`_)


5.0 (2019-05-10)
----------------

- Update PyPy version.

- Drop Python 3.4 support.

- Add support for Python 3.7.

- Avoid RuntimeError in _takeOutGarbage. See `issue 7
  <https://github.com/zopefoundation/tempstorage/issues/7>`_.


4.0.1 (2017-11-27)
------------------
- Raise POSKeyError instead of KeyError in loadBefore.


4.0 - 2017-03-09
----------------

- Drop Python 3.3 compatibility, add Python 3.6 compatibility.

- Require ZODB 5.0 or newer.

- Use `storage._lock` as a context manager.

- Declare PyPy compatibility.

  ZODB test requirements.

2.12.1 - 2010-09-29

-------------------

- Require at least ZODB 3.9 and adjusted method signatures to disuse versions.

- Expanded dependency on ZODB3 to include the test extra.
