Description: # bp-mll-tensorflow
        Efficient (vectorized) implementation of the BP-MLL loss function in TensorFlow (```bp_mll.py```). 
        
        BP-MLL is a loss function designed for multi-label classification using neural networks. It was introduced by Zhang & Zhou in [1]. Note that in line with [1], every sample needs to have at least one label and no sample may have all labels.
        
        # Installation 
        `pip3 install bpmll`
        
        # Usage
        ```
        from bpmll import bp_mll_loss
        ```
        Then simply use it as a function in your tensorflow or keras models.
        
        Check out ```full_example.py``` for an example of training a simple multilayer perceptron using Keras with BP-MLL.
