Description: # Timer Package for Python
        
        This is a simple timer package for python that counts `Down`  
        from the time set.  
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Scripting
        
        ```python
        # Import the timer module
        import timer
        
        # Create a variable named 'timer' and call the class 'timer'
        # Arguments are (hours, mins, secs, log)
        # Default is a 1h timer and not to print the time left
        # To print the time left, if all args are passsed, use 'log' otherwise copy below
        # This sets a timer for 3h 45mins and to print the time left
        timer = timer.Timer(3, 45,log='log')
        # Run the 'timer' function from the variable
        timer.timer()
        ```
        
        ### Interpreter
