### Code convention

Below are some of the standard practices applied to this repositories.

- **Etiquette: PEP8**
 	- All code is written in PEP8. It is recommended you use a linter as you work, flake8 and pylinter are both good options.
- **Etiquette: Napoleon docstrings**
	- Any docstrings are made in Google Napoleon format. See [Napoleon](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) for details.
- **Etiquette: Semantic Versioning**
	- This project follows [semantic versioning](http://semver.org).
- **Etiquette: Underscore means private**
	- Anything prefixed with an underscore means that it is internal to wherever it is used. For example, a variable name is only ever used in the parent function or class. A module is not for use by the end-user. In contrast, anything without an underscore is public, but not necessarily part of the API. Members of the API resides in `api.py`.
- **API: Idempotence**
 	- A public function must be able to be called twice and produce the exact same result. This means no changing of state without restoring previous state when finishing. For example, if a function requires changing the current selection in Autodesk Maya, it must restore the previous selection prior to completing.
