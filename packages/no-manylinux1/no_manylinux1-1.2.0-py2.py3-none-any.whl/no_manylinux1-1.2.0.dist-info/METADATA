no-manylinux1
=============

Install this package to disable manylinux1 wheels when downloading from pip.

## Usage

```
# First install no-manylinux1
pip install no-manylinux1
# Now subsequent invocations of pip will ignore manylinux1 wheels
pip install ...
# To restore the original behaviour, simply `pip uninstall no-manylinux1`
```

## What? Why?

The manylinux1 spec requires compliant packages to vendor binary dependencies
inside the wheel that is distributed.  Take for example a library which would
(prior to manylinux1) dynamically link against `libssl`.  As `libssl` received
security patches, the system binaries would received updates from the OS's
package manager.  The python library which dynamically links would receive
these updates for free without need to recompile, reinstall, etc.  Under
manylinux1, `libssl` is vendored inside the wheel.  To receive security
updates, you have to wait for the upstream to produce a new wheel and need to
know to install a new version of that library.  There's almost no visibility
about these vendored wheels which makes managing them at scale impossible.  As
such, some may choose to ignore this standard.
