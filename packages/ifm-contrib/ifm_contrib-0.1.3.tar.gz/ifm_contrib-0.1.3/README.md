# ifm_contrib

An Open Source Extension Project for the FEFLOW Programming API.

ifm_contrib requires FEFLOW version 7.2 (release planned late 2018). 
It is code-compatible with the standard IFM coming with the FEFLOW installation.

The code is free to use, share and modify. 
It is possible to create a private fork and make proprietary modifications.
Users are however encouraged to contribute their own code back to the main branch.

Note: the library is currently in BETA-status, thus changes may be made that will not be 
backwards compatible.
