Description: # ifm_contrib
        
        An Open Source Extension Project for the FEFLOW Programming API.
        
        ifm_contrib requires FEFLOW version 7.2. 
        It is code-compatible with the standard IFM coming with the FEFLOW installation.
        
        The code is free to use, share and modify. 
        It is possible to create a private fork and make proprietary modifications.
        Users are however encouraged to contribute their own code back to the main branch.
        
        Note: the library is currently in BETA-status, thus changes may be made that will not be 
        backwards compatible.
