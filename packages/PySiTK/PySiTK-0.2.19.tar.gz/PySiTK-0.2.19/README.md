# PySiTK 

PySiTK is a Python-based open-source toolkit that provides a collection of helper functions to facilitate IO, printing, plotting, ... and the interaction between [SimpleITK][simpleitk] and [ITK_NiftyMIC][itkniftymic].

The algorithm and software were developed by [Michael Ebner][mebner]
at the [Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Interventional and Surgical Sciences][weiss], [University College London (UCL)][ucl] (2015 -- 2019), and the [Department of Surgical and Interventional Sciences][sie], [King's College London (KCL)][kcl] (since 2019).
