        The simplest code to catch the ripe red  berry fruit video frame in OpenCV and turn it to HSV format.then grab the upper and lower 
        bounds of the color we would like to detect. In this case, we choose the values from yellow/red-ish to completely red.
        We create a numpy array containing these and create mask to catch perfect color, but this simple approach prone to undesirable  
        result, that's my many object detection  followed by **deep learning** module in OpenCV
        ***(dnn)***  is the OpenCVâ€™s module to load a pre-trained object detection network. there are many method & framework for object 
        detection using deep learning with different aspects of difficulty , implementation , speed and size
        on platform such raspberry-pi 3b+ Network architectures such as  ***MobileNets*** along with SSD(Single Shot Detectors) framework is 
        between our constraints and goals
