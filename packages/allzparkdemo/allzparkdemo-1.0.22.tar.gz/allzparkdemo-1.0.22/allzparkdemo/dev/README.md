### Local Development Directory

This folder is a representation of what a developer may have in his local development directory when creating or updating a project.

**Example**

```bash
dev/
	mgear/
	rez-bundles/
	core_pipeline/
		.git/
		core_pipeline/
			__init__.py
		README.md
```

It would start out empty, grow over time and vary amongst developers.

1. Start at a company
2. Clone an existing project into your local `~/dev` directory
3. Edit
4. Release onto your `rez_release_path`
