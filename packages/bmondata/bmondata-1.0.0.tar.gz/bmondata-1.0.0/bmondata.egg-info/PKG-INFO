Description: # bmondata
        Allows easy access to sensor data residing on a [BMON Server](https://github.com/alanmitchell/bmon).
        
        This package provides a wrapper around the the BMON API, version 2.  It allows retrieval
        of key data stored in the BMON database, including sensor readings, sensor metadata, building
        information, and organization information.  It is not comprehensive as some BMON information is
        not available.  It also allows for storage of new sensor readings in a BMON
        sensor reading database.
        
        Usage examples are [shown here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/alanmitchell/bmondata/blob/master/examples/usage_examples.html).
        The docstring for each method gives additional information.
