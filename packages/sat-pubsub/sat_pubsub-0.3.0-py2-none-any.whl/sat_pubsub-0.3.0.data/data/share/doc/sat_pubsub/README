** ABOUT **

SàT PubSub is a XMPP PubSub/PEP component (XEP-0060) It's based on Ralph
Meijer's Idavoll, and provides special features necessary for the « Salut à
Toi » project (https://salut-a-toi.org), but it can also be used for any other
XMPP project.  The use of a standard external component allow to use this
features with most XMPP servers.  One of the main addition is fine access
tuning for PubSub, which allow the publication of items for only some groups,
even if the entire node is open. The protocol is explained on
https://www.goffi.org/post/2012/06/24/Fine-access-tuning-for-PubSub for the
moment, and a protoxep should be proposed to the XSF in the future...
