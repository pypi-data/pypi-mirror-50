Description: 
        # gstackutils
        
        ## The workhorse of the `galaktika.gstack` project.
        
        The project `gstack` is boilerplate or even a meta-framework that helps the
        setup and operation of a single host Django web application deployment based on
        Docker.
        
        The software stack `gstack` refers to consists of the following:
        
        - Postgresql as the backend database
        - Django as the application server
        - Nginx as the webserver
        
        Based on the experience of maintaining and operating business critical Django
        applications based on Docker we collected some common functions and patterns
        and wrapped them in this python package.
