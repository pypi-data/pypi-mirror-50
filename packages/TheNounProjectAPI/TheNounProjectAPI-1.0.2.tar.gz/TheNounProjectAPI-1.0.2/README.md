# Getting started
It's strongly encouraged to use the [documentation]()'s [Getting started]() section to get started, as it's tied to the rest of the documentation, allowing you to quickly find exactly what you need.

However, I'll provide a quick sample.
```python
import TheNounProjectAPI

key = "<sample key>"
secret = "<sample secret>"

api = TheNounProjectAPI(key=key, secret=secret)

icons = api.get_icons_by_term("goat", public_domain_only=True, limit=2)

# >>>icons
# [<IconModel: Term: Goat Feeding, Slug: goat-feeding, Id: 24014>,
# <IconModel: Term: Herbivore teeth, Slug: herbivore-teeth, Id: 675870>]

for icon in icons:
    print("Icon's term:", icon.term)
    print("This icon's tags:", ", ".join(tag.slug for tag in icon.tags))
    print("Uploader's username:", icon.uploader.username)
```
