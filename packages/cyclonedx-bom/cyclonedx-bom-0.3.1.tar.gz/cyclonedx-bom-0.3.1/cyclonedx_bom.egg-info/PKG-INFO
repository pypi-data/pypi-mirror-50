Description: 
        CycloneDX Python Module
        =======================
        
        The CycloneDX module for Python creates a valid CycloneDX bill-of-material document containing an aggregate of all project dependencies. CycloneDX is a lightweight BoM specification that is easily created, human readable, and simple to parse. The resulting bom.xml can be used with tools such as `OWASP Dependency-Track <https://dependencytrack.org/>`_ for the continuous analysis of components.
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        **Freezing**
        
        A bill-of-material such as CycloneDX expects exact version numbers. Therefore requirements.txt must be frozen. This can
        be accomplished via:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip freeze > requirements.txt
        
        
        **Installing**
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ pip install cyclonedx-bom
        
        
        **Options**
        
        By default, requirements.txt will be read from the current working directory and the resulting bom.xml will also 
        be created in the current working directory. These options can be overwritten as follows:
        
        .. code-block:: console
        
            $ cyclonedx-py
              Usage:  cyclonedx-py [OPTIONS]
              Options:
                -i <path> - the alternate filename to a frozen requirements.txt
                -o <path> - the bom file to create
