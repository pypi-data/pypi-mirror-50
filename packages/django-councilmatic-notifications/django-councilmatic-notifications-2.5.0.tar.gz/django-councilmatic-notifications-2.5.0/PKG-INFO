Description: django-councilmatic-notifications
        =================================
        
        This is a Django app with notification functions for the `Councilmatic family <http://www.councilmatic.org/>`_, a set of web apps for keeping tabs on local city council. It is built upon the open civic data standard, and ultimately makes Councilmatic easier to re-deploy in new cities.
        
        The `Councilmatic family <http://www.councilmatic.org/>`_ includes:
        
        - Philly Councilmatic (the original & first Councilmatic, by Mjumbe Poe. since it preceded django-councilmatic, it does not use django-councilmatic)
        - Chicago Councilmatic (launched & built on django-councilmatic)
        - New York City Councilmatic (launched & built on django-councilmatic)
        
        Councilmatic in your city
        -------------------------
        
        If you're interested in bringing Councilmatic to your city, `contact us <mailto:info@councilmatic.org>`_! We'd love to help.
