Minor and major releases
========================

Major releases
--------------

Major releases have version numbers 0.x.0, and contain major new features and
any API breaking code. They should be released whenever new features are
ready. Development is done on the `master` branch.

Minor releases
--------------

Minor releases have version numbers 0.x.y, where y is greater than zero, and
contain bug fixes and small improvements (including documentation improvements).
Development should be done on the `master` branch, and then changes backported
to the `v0.x.x` branch. Minor releases can be released rapidly, when any
changes are made.
