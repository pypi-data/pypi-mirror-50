HelioPy 0.8.1 (2019-08-14)
==========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix :func:`heliopy.data.helios.mag_4hz` data downloading (`#741 <https://github.com/heliopython/heliopy/pull/741>`__)
- Switch IMP downloading from FTP site to HTTPS site, since anonymous FTP access
  to NASA servers no longer works. (`#749 <https://github.com/heliopython/heliopy/pull/749>`__)


HelioPy 0.8.0 (2019-06-24)
==========================

Features
--------

- :func:`heliopy.data.cdasrest.get_cdas_url` and :func:`heliopy.data.cdasrest.get_data`
  have been generalised, and can now be used to download data in an arbitrary
  interval instead of just a single day. (`#714 <https://github.com/heliopython/heliopy/pull/714>`__)
- :mod:`heliopy.data.ace` functions that download low cadence data (e.g. composition
  data) now download yearly instead of daily files, speeding up data download. (`#715 <https://github.com/heliopython/heliopy/pull/715>`__)


Backwards Incompatible Changes
------------------------------

- :func:`heliopy.data.cdasrest.get_cdas_url` and :func:`heliopy.data.cdasrest.get_data`
  now take ``starttime`` and ``endtime`` arguments instead of just a ``date``
  argument, and their signatures have changed to reflect this. (`#714 <https://github.com/heliopython/heliopy/pull/714>`__)


HelioPy 0.7.1 (2019-06-10)
==========================

Bug Fixes
---------

- Fix bug that prevented MMS data from spacecraft 4 being downloaded. (`#719 <https://github.com/heliopython/heliopy/pull/719>`__)
- Correctly attach units to MMS data. (`#726 <https://github.com/heliopython/heliopy/pull/726>`__)

Version 0.7.0
=============

New features
------------

- Added a graph showing the available coordinate transformations to
  :mod:`heliopy.coordinates`
- Added STEREO-B kernels to :mod:`heliopy.data.spice`
- Added automatic spice kernel detection for the STEREO spacecraft to
  :mod:`heliopy.data.spice`
- Switched the download progress bar from ``wget`` based to ``tqdm`` based,
  which should work better in notebooks.

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed a bug where not all MMS files were downloaded for a large query.
- Correctly removed bad values in :mod:`heliopy.data.omni`.

Removed features
----------------

- The deprecated :func:`heliopy.data.wind.swe_h3` and
  :func:`heliopy.data.wind.threedp_sfpd` have been removed.


Version 0.6.7
=============

Deprecations
------------

- :func:`heliopy.data.wind.swe_h3` and :func:`heliopy.data.wind.threedp_sfpd`
  are deprecated and will be removed in version 0.7.0. This is becaue they
  currently use pandas MultiIndex structures, which are not the recommended
  way to store 2-or-more dimensional data. In the future they are likely to be
  re-written to use xarray.

Version 0.6.6
=============

Bug fixes
---------

- Data downloaded through CDAS is now moved from a temporary folder using
  ``shutil``, fixing it when the temp folder and destination folder are on
  different filesystems.

Version 0.6.5
=============

Bug fixes
---------

- :func:`heliopy.data.spice.get_kernel` now raises a warning instead of an
  error if a kernel can't be downloaded.
- :func:`heliopy.data.helios.merged` now filters out bad values and converts
  them to NaNs.
- :mod:`heliopy.spice` now only loads core SPICE kernels once, instead of every
  time the module is imported.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- :func:`heliopy.data.spice.get_kernel` now prints a warning instead of
  raising an error if a kernel cannot be downloaded.

Version 0.6.4
=============

New features
------------

- Added the ability for :class:`heliopy.spice.Trajectory` objects to compute
  and return the body velocity.
- Available spice kernels in :mod:`heliopy.data.spice` are now split into
  kernels that have been reconstructed (ie. actual trajectories) and
  predicted trajectories.
- The predicted Bepi Columbo spice kernel has been added to
  :mod:`heliopy.data.spice`
- The :func:`heliopy.data.ace.swi_h3b` function has been added.
- :func:`heliopy.data.cdasrest.get_variables` and
  :func:`heliopy.data.cdasrest.get_data` now have a ``timeout`` keyword
  argument, allowing manual specification of the timeout when fetching data
  from a server.
- Importing :mod:`heliopy.spice` now automatically loads common heliospheric
  coordinate systems.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- Kernels available in :mod:`heliopy.data.spice` have been cleaned up,
  meaning some are now not available or have been moved to the predicted
  section.
- A handful of data download functions have migrated to using the CDAS restful
  service, and have therefore had their call signatures changed. In particular:
  - :func:`heliopy.data.messenger.mag_rtn` has lost its ``try_download`` kwarg
  - :func:`heliopy.data.helios.merged` has lost its ``try_download`` kwarg

The following IMP download functions, which only ever worked for IMP8 have
been renamed:

- `mitplasma_h0` has been renamed :func:`~heliopy.data.imp.i8_mitplasma`
- `mag320ms` has been renamed :func:`~heliopy.data.imp.i8_mag320ms`

Version 0.6.3
=============

New features
------------

- Added Parker Solar Probe spice kernels to :mod:`heliopy.data.spice`.
- Added a generic functions to download MMS data. Available files can be
  queried using :meth:`heliopy.data.mms.available_files`, and files can be
  downloaded using :meth:`heliopy.data.mms.download_files`

Bug fixes
---------

- Updated links to the STEREO-A spice kernels.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- :meth:`heliopy.data.mms.fgm_survey` has been removed in favour of the more
  general :meth:`heliopy.data.mms.fgm`. To download survey mode FGM data use
  the new method and set the ``mode`` keyword argument to ``srvy``.

Version 0.6.2
=============

New features
------------

- Added :meth:`heliopy.data.mms.fpi_des_moms` function. :issue:`601`
- Added :meth:`heliopy.data.wind.threedp_e0_emfits` function. :issue:`606`

Bug fixes
---------

- Fixed :meth:`heliopy.data.mms.fgm_survey` data loading. :issue:`601`

Version 0.6.1
=============

New features
------------
- The :mod:`heliopy.data.ace` module now contains all the magnetic field and
  particle data produces produced by ACE. :issue:`577`, :issue:`578`
- STEREO-A spice kernels have been added. :issue:`585`


Bug fixes
---------
- The accidentally removed Ulysses spice kernel has returned. :issue:`582`
- :func:`heliopy.data.helper.cdfpeek` has been updated to work with cdflib, and now
  prints all CDF file information.

Version 0.6.0
=============

HelioPy now only supports Python versions 3.6 and higher.

New features
------------
- HelioPy has been integrated with SunPy TimeSeries and AstroPy Units. All of
  the HelioPy modules now return physical units with data.
- Added a new :func:`.data.util.cdf_units` function that can extract the UNIT
  attribute from CDF files.
- Low resolution OMNI data import has been added in
  :func:`.data.omni.low` function.
- Magnetic Field data from DSCOVR Spacecraft
  can now be imported using the :func:`.data.dscovr.mag_h0` function.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------
- Methods in :mod:`heliopy.data` no longer returns a Pandas DataFrame, but
  now return a SunPy timeseries object. To get the underlying data, you can
  still do::

    dataframe = timeseries.data

  For an example of how to use the new object, see
  :ref:`sphx_glr_auto_examples_plot_timeseries.py`.
- Data import has had a major overhaul, so that every column in CDF files now
  gets automatically imported and retains its name without being changed by
  HelioPy. This means column names in several data products are now different,
  to reflect their original name in the CDF files instead of a custom name
  that was previously assigned by HelioPy.
- :func:`.data.helios.merged`, :func:`.data.helios.mag_4hz`,
  :func:`.data.helios.corefit` and :func:`.data.helios.mag_ness` no longer take
  a `verbose` keyword argument. :issue:`467`


Fixed bugs
----------
- :func:`.data.imp.merged` no longer imports redundant columns.

Version 0.5.3
=============

New features
------------

- Lots of small documentation updates.
- `.data.helios.distparams` now has an extra ``'data_rate'`` column, which
  determines whether a given distribution function was transmitted in high or
  low data mode. :issue:`529`

Version 0.5.2
=============

New features
------------

- The new HelioPy logo has been added to the documentation.
  :issue:`448`, :issue:`447`

Fixed bugs
----------

- The new data version number of :meth:`.data.mms.fpi_dis_moms` has been
  updated.


Version 0.5.1
=============

New features
------------

- HelioPy can now be installed using conda.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------
- The list of kernels available for automatic download in :mod:`.data.spice`
  has been updated, and some names changed. :issue:`408`

Fixed bugs
----------
- :meth:`.spice.Trajectory.generate_positions` can now generate
  positions at a resolution of one second instead of one day. :issue:`405`
- A duplicate "z gsm" column header in the data returned by
  :meth:`.data.imp.mag15s` has been corrected. :issue:`396`

Version 0.5.0
=============

New features
------------

- :meth:`heliopy.data.sunspot` added an additional functionality to import
  sunspot data in three different timeframes - daily, monthly and yearly.
- The inventory of spice kernels in :mod:`heliopy.data.spice` now includes
  "Helios 1 Reconstructed", "Helios 1 Predicted", "Juno Reconstructed",
  "Juno Predicted" and "Helios 2" kernels.
- :meth:`heliopy.spice.furnish` now accepts a list of filenames as well as
  individual filenames.
- A lot of new functions for downloading ACE data have been added to
  :mod:`heliopy.data.ace`.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- :meth:`heliopy.data.spice.get_kernel` now returns a list of filenames instead
  of a single filename string.
- Most of the functions that were in :mod:`heliopy.data.helper` have been
  moved to :mod:`heliopy.data.util`. The ones the remain in
  :mod:`heliopy.data.helper` are useful for users, and the ones in
  :mod:`heliopy.data.util` are used internally as utility functions for
  data import.

Removed features
----------------

- :meth:`heliopy.data.helios.trajectory` has been removed. To get Helios
  trajectory data use the :mod:`heliopy.spice` and :mod:`heliopy.data.spice`
  modules.

Version 0.4
===========

New features
------------

- :meth:`~heliopy.data.ulysses.swics_abundances` and
  :meth:`~heliopy.data.ulysses.swics_heavy_ions`
  methods added for loading SWICS data from the Ulysses mission.
- :meth:`~heliopy.data.helper.cdfpeek` method added for peeking inside
  CDF files.

Backwards incompatible changes
------------------------------

- :meth:`heliopy.spice.Trajectory.generate_positions` now takes a list of
  dates/times at which to generate orbital positions, instead of a start time,
  stop time, and number of steps. The old behaviour can be recovered by
  manually generating an evenly spaced list of times.

Version 0.3
===========

New features
------------

HelioPy now contiains code for working with SPICE kernels. See the following
modules for more information:

- :mod:`heliopy.data.spice` module for downloading spice kernels
- :mod:`heliopy.spice` module for automatically processing spice kernels

Removed features
----------------

- The :mod:`heliopy.plasma` module has been removed
  (see http://www.plasmapy.org/ for the recommended alternative)
- :mod:`heliopy.plot` code removed

Version 0.2
===========

New features
------------

- Convert examples gallery to automatically generate plots
- Added :meth:`HelioPy.data.helper.listdata` method for easily viewing the
  amount of data HelioPy is storing locally.
- Added :meth:`heliopy.data.wind.threedp_sfpd` method for importing
  WIND 3DP sfpd data.

Version 0.1.3
=============

Fixed bugs
----------

- Correctly report download percentage when downloading files.
- Fix issue where :meth:`heliopy.data.helios.corefit` made duplicate .hdf
  files on days where no data is available.
