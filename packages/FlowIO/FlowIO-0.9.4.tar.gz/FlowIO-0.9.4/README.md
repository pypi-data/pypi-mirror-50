# FlowIO

A Python library for reading and writing Flow Cytometry Standard (FCS) files. This library has zero dependencies and works in both Python 2 and 3. It retrieves event data exactly as it is encoded in the FCS file, as a 1-dimensional list without separating the events into channels. For higher level interaction with flow cytometry data, including GatingML support, see the related [FlowKit](https://github.com/whitews/FlowKit) project
