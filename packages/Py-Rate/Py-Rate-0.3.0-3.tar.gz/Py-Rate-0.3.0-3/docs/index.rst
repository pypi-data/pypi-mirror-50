PyRate documentation
====================

This is the documentation for the **PyRate** software.

**PyRate** is a Python tool for estimating the average rate (velocity) and
cumulative displacement time-series of surface movements for every pixel in
a stack of geocoded unwrapped interferograms generated by Interferometric
Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) processing. **PyRate** currently supports
input data in the GAMMA or ROI_PAC software formats.

The **PyRate** project started in 2012 as a partial Python translation of
"Pirate", a Matlab tool developed by the University of Leeds and the Guangdong
University of Technology.
