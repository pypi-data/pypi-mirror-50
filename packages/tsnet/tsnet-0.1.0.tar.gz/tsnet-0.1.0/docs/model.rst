====================
Transient Model
====================

The transient model inheritS the WNTR water network model [WNTRSi]_,
which includes
junctions, tanks, reservoirs, pipes, pumps, valves,
patterns,
curves,
controls,
sources,
simulation options,
and node coordinates.
It can be built directly from an EPANet INP file.
Sections of EPANet INP file that are not compatible with WNTR are
described in [WNTRSi]_.

Compared with WNTR water network model, TSNet transient model adds the features
designed specifically for transient simulation, such as
spatial discretization,
temporal discretization,
valve operation rules,
pump operation rules,
burst opening rules, and
storage of time history results.
For more information on the water network model, see
:class:`~tsnet.network.model.TransientModel` in the API documentation.


Build a model from an INP file
---------------------------------

A transient model can be created directly from an EPANet INP file.
The following example build a transient model.


.. code:: python

    inp_file = 'examples/networks/Tnet1.inp'
    tm = tsnet.network.TransientModel(inp_file)
