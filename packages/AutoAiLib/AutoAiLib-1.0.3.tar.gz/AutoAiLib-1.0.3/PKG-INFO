Description: <h1>AutoAI</h1>
        <p>This repository is a compilation of scripts that I have created in my time working with machine learning. These scripts aim to automate the annoying and tedious parts of ML, allowing you to focus on what is important.
        PyPi: https://pypi.org/project/AutoAILib/
        </br> $ pip install autoailib </br>
        This library was developed for and used with keras convolutional neural networks. They do however work with other keras models, besides image test obviously.</p>

            <h1> AutoAiLib.general_tester(model path or object, labels, preprocessor)</h1>
            <a href="https://youtu.be/TQisVhgUzWo"> Class Video Demo</a>
            <h2> AutoAiLib.general_tester.predict_single(example)</h2>
            <ul><li>example- If you have defined a preprocessor for your tester, this should comply with the preprocessor's argument. If
                you have not defined a preprocessor, example must be in a form that your model will accept.</li></ul>
            <h2> AutoAiLib.general_tester.predict_many(container=None, testing_folder = None, csv_dir)</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li> container - This can be a container of test objects (any iterable). If preprocessor is defined, these objects must comply with the preprocessors parameter. Otherwise they must be in a form that your model will accept.</li>
                    <li> testing_dir - This can be a path to a testing folder which has sub folders of all classes. Again, must be preprocessed or have preprocessor defined.</li>
                    <li> csv_dir - This function compiles data into a csv folder to allow users to easily extract data from it, if not defined it will return a pandas data frame.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2> AutoAi.image_predict(model_path, image_path, labels)</h2>
            <h5> This function takes 3 arguments: a path to a keras model, a path to an image, and a list of labels.</h5>
            <h5> Demo:</h5>
            Given a the correct arguments, we get the following output, as well as this image saved to our model directory.

          <h2> AutoAi.manual_test(model, testing_dir, labels) </h2>
          <h5> This function tests a model given labels and testing data. It then compiles the results in a CSV file, and groups the results by class, and by correct and incorrect.</h5>
          <ul> 
            <li> Model - Path of model that you want to test or model object.</li>
            <li> Testing_dir - Path to the directory with your testing data.</li>
            <li> Labels - Dictionary of the classes, in form (index:class_name)</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Example csv:</h5>

            <h2>Update! This has now been packaged in the AutoAI.data_compiler class.
              AutoAi.data_compiler(self,src, dest, **kwargs)</br>
              AutoAi.data_compiler.run() will compile the data based on the constructor parameters. </h2>
            <h5> This function takes 2 required arguments, an original data source file, and a path to the desired data directory. Given just these two arguments, this function will create a new testing data folder at dest with training, validation, and testing folders, containing folders for each class. You can alter the ratio with the ratio arguments, as well as provide a number of img transforms to do if you are using images.</h5>
            <ul>
              <li> Src - Path to a folder that contains a folder for each class and then data examples in those class folders. </li>
              <li> Dest - Path to a folder where you want the data to end up. </li>
              <li> Num_imgs_per_class - This number of images will be added to the original set for each class through transforms. The theoretical limit for this would be 3! * original images per class </li>
              </ul>
              <h5> Demo:</h5>
              Given the a path to the following folder:
              <img src="https://i.imgur.com/SSpydEv.png"></img>
              If augmentation used the following results will be yielded:
              <img src="https://i.imgur.com/4okyMrN.png"></img>
              Then these images will be copied to the dest folder with copied file structure, but an added upper layer:
