The python interface classes for VitaOptimum
============================================

VitaOptimum is a library which solvers are designed to find a globally best solution of non-linear models in the possible or known presence of multiple local optima and constraints. The python package contains interface classes for the library. VitaOptimum Library efficiently handles any type of arguments to optimize including continuous, mixed-variables, combinatorial permutations, integer or binary. It can deal with any type of constraints: boundary, equality or inequality ones. It gives freedom to express models in a language that are closer to reality, which makes the final solution closer to reality.

Requirements
------------
* VitaOptimum library 1.x
* Python 3.7 and higher
* Python packages: numpy, matplotlib, retrying
