About
=====

Python package for easy generation of numerical phantoms.  I often
need a simple image to try something out on.  In MATLAB, I would use
the `phantom` command to quickly get something to work with.  In
Python, it's not quite so easy, so I made this package that's quick
to install and use so there's as little friction as possible.  There
are other implementations of Shepp-Logan available from other
projects, but they are usually not as easy to install or include other
things that I don't want for this project.

Usage
=====

Basic usage:

.. code-block:: python

    from phantominator import shepp_logan
    ph = shepp_logan(128)

Also see the `examples` module.  The interface is similar to MATLAB's
`phantom` function.
